1. Pest Identification (2/3) [The description accurately identifies the pest as a moth, likely belonging to the Noctuidae family, but does not specifically identify it as a Cloverworm, which is the ground truth pest classification. The description provides some relevant details about the moth's appearance and potential relationship to crop pests, but lacks the specificity required for full credit.]

2. Damage Description (3/3) [The description thoroughly describes the visible damage to the leaf, including signs of wilting and discoloration, and acknowledges the possibility of future issues if the moth's larvae are known to feed on crops. The description provides a clear and complete assessment of the current plant health impact.]

3. Management Recommendations (3/3) [The description provides specific, actionable, and appropriate recommendations for monitoring the crop, scouting for signs of larvae activity, and applying insecticidal treatments if necessary. It also suggests preventative measures like crop rotation and good field sanitation, which are relevant and effective pest management strategies.]

Miscellaneous (-1) [The description incorrectly states that the moth does not belong to the common list of agricultural pests, when in fact the ground truth classification is Cloverworm, which is a known crop pest. This inaccuracy warrants a deduction of 1 point.]
