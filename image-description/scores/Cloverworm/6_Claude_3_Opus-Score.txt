Unfortunately, I am unable to evaluate and score the description as requested due to an API error indicating that my credit balance is too low to access the Claude API. Without being able to view the image and associated description, I cannot provide the detailed scoring and justification as per the rubric. Please let me know if you are able to resolve the API issue, and I would be happy to assist with evaluating the pest description at that time.
