1. Pest Identification (3/3) [The description accurately identifies the pest as a Japanese Beetle (Popillia japonica) and correctly describes its distinctive metallic green body and copper-colored wing covers, as well as the white tufts of hair along the sides of its abdomen. The description clearly locates the pest on the green leaf in the image.]

2. Damage Description (3/3) [The description thoroughly explains the typical feeding behavior of Japanese Beetles, noting that they tend to skeletonize leaves by eating the tissue between the veins, leaving behind a lace-like appearance. While the image does not show active feeding, the description correctly states that the presence of a single beetle can indicate a larger infestation nearby and the potential for significant harm to a wide variety of plants.]

3. Management Recommendations (3/3) [The description provides specific, actionable, and appropriate pest management recommendations, including hand-picking beetles and dropping them into soapy water for small infestations, using insecticides containing carbaryl, acephate, or pyrethrins for larger infestations, deploying pheromone traps to lure and capture beetles, introducing biological control methods like parasitic wasps or nematodes, and maintaining healthy plants through proper watering and fertilization. The recommendations cover both immediate and long-term strategies to effectively manage this persistent pest.]

Miscellaneous (0) [No points deducted, the description is comprehensive and accurate.]
