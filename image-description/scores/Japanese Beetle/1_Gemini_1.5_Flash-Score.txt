1. Pest Identification (2/3) [The description accurately identifies the pest as Northern Corn Rootworm, but lacks specificity on its position on the crop. The image shows damage to the corn plant, but the pest itself is not visible.]

2. Damage Description (3/3) [The description thoroughly describes the visible damage to the corn plant, including the skeletonized leaves and the plant's stressed and wilting appearance. It accurately links the damage patterns to the rootworm's feeding behavior.]

3. Management Recommendations (3/3) [The description provides specific, actionable, and appropriate pest management recommendations, including the use of insecticides, planting resistant corn varieties, crop rotation, and monitoring for adult rootworms.]

Miscellaneous (0) [No significant errors or omissions noted.]
