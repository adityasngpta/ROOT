1. Pest Identification (3/3) [The description accurately identifies the pest as a Japanese Beetle (Popillia japonica) and correctly describes its distinctive metallic green body and copper-colored wing covers, which are characteristic of this invasive species.]

2. Damage Description (3/3) [The description thoroughly explains the potential damage that Japanese Beetles can cause, including skeletonizing leaves, feeding on flowers and fruits, and leading to significant crop loss in berry plantations. The description also notes that while the current image does not show extensive damage, the presence of the beetle is concerning and likely part of a larger population that could rapidly defoliate the plants if left unchecked.]

3. Management Recommendations (3/3) [The description provides specific, actionable, and appropriate pest management recommendations, including handpicking beetles, using pheromone traps, applying neem oil or pyrethrin-based insecticides, encouraging natural predators, avoiding over-watering and over-fertilizing, and planting resistant varieties in the future. The recommendations cover a comprehensive integrated pest management (IPM) approach.]

Miscellaneous (0) [No points deducted, the description is comprehensive and accurate.]
