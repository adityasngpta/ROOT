1. Pest Identification (3/3) [The description accurately identifies the pest as a Japanese Beetle (Popillia japonica) and correctly describes its distinctive metallic green body and coppery wing covers, which are characteristic of this invasive pest species.]

2. Damage Description (3/3) [The description thoroughly explains the potential for Japanese Beetles to cause significant damage by feeding on the soft tissue between leaf veins, leading to a skeletal appearance on affected foliage. It also notes that while the image does not show visible damage, the presence of even a single beetle is concerning as they often appear in large numbers and can quickly defoliate plants.]

3. Management Recommendations (3/3) [The description provides specific, actionable, and appropriate pest management recommendations, including hand-picking beetles, using insecticidal soaps or neem oil, and encouraging natural predators. It also discusses the importance of preventive measures, such as maintaining healthy plants and avoiding highly attractive plants, as well as the need for regular monitoring and prompt action to prevent widespread damage.]

Miscellaneous (0) [No points deducted, the description is comprehensive and accurate.]

Total Score: (9/9)
