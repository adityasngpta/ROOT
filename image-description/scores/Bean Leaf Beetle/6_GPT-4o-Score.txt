1. Pest Identification (3/3) [The description accurately identifies the pest as the Southern Corn Rootworm, also known as the Spotted Cucumber Beetle, and correctly describes its distinctive yellowish-green color and black spots, which match the characteristics of the pest in the image.]

2. Damage Description (3/3) [The description thoroughly describes the visible damage to the leaf, including holes and surface scraping, which is typical of feeding by the Southern Corn Rootworm. It also explains how the larvae can cause significant damage to crops by compromising the root structure and nutrient uptake, leading to stunted growth and reduced yield.]

3. Management Recommendations (3/3) [The description provides specific, actionable, and appropriate pest management recommendations, including monitoring the crop fields, applying insecticides if the infestation exceeds economic thresholds, using crop rotation to break the life cycle of the beetles, applying biological control agents or insecticidal seed treatments to protect the roots, and ensuring field hygiene by removing crop residues to reduce overwintering sites for the adult beetles.]
