1. Pest Identification (3/3) [The description accurately identifies the pest as a Western Corn Rootworm beetle (Diabrotica virgifera virgifera) and correctly describes its physical characteristics, including the yellowish-green coloration with black stripes along the wing covers.]

2. Damage Description (3/3) [The description thoroughly explains the potential damage caused by the Western Corn Rootworm, including the larvae feeding on corn roots, which can lead to reduced nutrient uptake, increased susceptibility to drought stress, and potential lodging of corn plants, resulting in substantial yield losses.]

3. Management Recommendations (3/3) [The description provides specific, actionable, and appropriate pest management recommendations, including crop rotation, planting transgenic corn varieties, using soil-applied insecticides or seed treatments, and applying foliar insecticides if adult beetle populations exceed economic thresholds. The recommendations also emphasize the importance of an Integrated Pest Management (IPM) approach for sustainable long-term management.]

Miscellaneous (0) [No points deducted, as the description is comprehensive and accurate.]
