1. Pest Identification (2/3) [The description correctly identifies the pest as a Green Beetle, likely a Grape Colaspis, but does not accurately match the ground truth classification of Northern Corn Rootworm. The description provides some details about the pest's appearance and typical habitat, but lacks the specificity required to fully identify the correct pest species.]

2. Damage Description (3/3) [The description thoroughly explains the potential damage caused by the Grape Colaspis, including notched leaf edges, skeletonized foliage, and reduced plant vigor. The impact on the plant's ability to photosynthesize is also well-described.]

3. Management Recommendations (3/3) [The description provides specific, actionable, and appropriate pest management recommendations, including the use of insecticidal soap or neem oil, as well as preventive measures like proper crop rotation and regular scouting.]

Miscellaneous (-1) [The description incorrectly identifies the pest as a Grape Colaspis, when the ground truth classification is Northern Corn Rootworm. This significant error warrants a deduction of 1 point.]
