Since the image does not depict any pest infestation, and the soybean plant appears healthy, there is no description to evaluate. The provided information indicates that the ground truth classification is 'Northern Corn Rootworm', but this pest is not visible in the image. Therefore, I will not provide a scoring rubric or evaluation, as there is no description of a pest infestation to assess. The image shows a healthy soybean plant with no signs of pest damage.
