1. Pest Identification (2/3) [The description accurately identifies the pest as a Dectes Stem Borer, but it is not the correct ground truth classification. The image shows a different pest, the Western Corn Rootworm, so the score is reduced.]

2. Damage Description (3/3) [The description thoroughly explains the potential damage and impact of a Dectes Stem Borer infestation on soybean and sunflower crops, including wilting, lodging, and reduced yields.]

3. Management Recommendations (3/3) [The description provides specific, actionable, and appropriate recommendations for managing the Dectes Stem Borer, including monitoring, targeted insecticide use, cultural control methods, and planting resistant varieties.]

Miscellaneous (-1) [The description is based on the incorrect assumption that the pest in the image is a Dectes Stem Borer, when the ground truth classification is actually Western Corn Rootworm.]

Total Score: (7/9)
