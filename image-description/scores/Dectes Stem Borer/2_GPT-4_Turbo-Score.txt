1. Pest Identification (3/3) [The description accurately identifies the pest as the Dectes Stem Borer, providing clear details on its physical characteristics such as the robust, cylindrical body, smooth gray to light blue exoskeleton, and long black antennae. The description also correctly states that this pest typically targets soybean and sunflower crops.]

2. Damage Description (3/3) [The description thoroughly explains the visible damage caused by the Dectes Stem Borer, including wilting of plants due to the larva tunneling through the stem, which disrupts the plant's ability to transport water and nutrients. It also accurately describes the potential for stem breakage, particularly during strong winds or heavy rain, leading to direct yield loss.]

3. Management Recommendations (3/3) [The description provides specific, actionable, and appropriate pest management recommendations, including crop rotation, removing and destroying infested crop residue post-harvest, delayed planting to allow larvae to emerge before the new crop is planted, and the use of spot treatments with approved insecticides if the infestation is localized. The recommendation to employ an integrated pest management strategy is also relevant and well-advised.]

Miscellaneous (0) [No deductions necessary, the description is comprehensive and accurate.]
