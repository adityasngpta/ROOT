1. Pest Identification (2/3) [The description does not identify the specific pest species, but provides a general overview of what to look for in terms of pest-related issues on the plant.]

2. Damage Description (3/3) [The description thoroughly explains the potential impacts of pest feeding on the plant, including reduced photosynthesis, weakened structural integrity, and lower yields.]

3. Management Recommendations (3/3) [The description provides specific, actionable, and appropriate recommendations for integrated pest management, including cultural practices, biological controls, and targeted pesticide use. The advice to consult local experts is also relevant.]

Miscellaneous (0) [No significant errors or omissions.]
