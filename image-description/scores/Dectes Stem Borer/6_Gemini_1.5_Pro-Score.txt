Since the image does not depict any pest infestation or damage, and the description accurately reflects the healthy soybean plant shown, I will not provide a scoring evaluation. The description is appropriate for the given image, which does not contain the ground truth pest 'Dectes Stem Borer'. No scoring is necessary in this case.
