It also mentions that the adult beetles can cause defoliation, prompting the need for close monitoring and potential management.]

3. Management Recommendations (3/3) [The description provides specific, actionable, and appropriate pest management recommendations, including crop rotation as a primary cultural control strategy, the use of soil insecticides at planting or foliar applications targeting adults, and the importance of regular field scouting to assess the pest population levels and plant health.]
