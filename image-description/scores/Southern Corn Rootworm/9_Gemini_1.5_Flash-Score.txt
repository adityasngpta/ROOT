1. Pest Identification (2/3) [The description correctly identifies the pest as the Northern Corn Rootworm adult beetle, but it does not accurately match the ground truth classification of Southern Corn Rootworm. The description loses a point for this discrepancy.]

2. Damage Description (3/3) [The description thoroughly and accurately describes the visible damage caused by the Northern Corn Rootworm beetle, including the small, irregularly shaped holes on the leaves indicating active feeding. The potential future impact on the plant's growth and yield is also well-explained.]

3. Management Recommendations (3/3) [The description provides specific, actionable, and appropriate pest management recommendations, including the use of targeted insecticides and preventive cultural practices such as crop rotation, resistant corn varieties, and soil disruption techniques. These recommendations are well-suited to address the Northern Corn Rootworm infestation.]

Miscellaneous (0) [No significant errors, omissions, or irrelevant information noted.]
