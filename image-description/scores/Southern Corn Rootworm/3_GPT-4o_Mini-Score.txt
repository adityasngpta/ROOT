The description provided does not accurately identify the pest in the image as the Southern Corn Rootworm. Based on the image, the insect appears to be a type of beetle with distinctive yellow and black coloration, which suggests it may belong to the family of lady beetles or ladybugs, rather than the Southern Corn Rootworm.
