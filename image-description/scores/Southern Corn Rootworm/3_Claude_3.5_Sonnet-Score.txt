1. Pest Identification (3/3) [The description accurately identifies the pest as a Bean Leaf Beetle (Cerotoma trifurcata) and correctly describes its position on the soybean leaf.]

2. Damage Description (3/3) [The description thoroughly explains the typical feeding damage caused by Bean Leaf Beetles, including the creation of small round holes between leaf veins, reduction in photosynthetic capacity, and potential for defoliation. It also mentions the ability of these beetles to transmit bean pod mottle virus, which can further impact crop yield and quality.]

3. Management Recommendations (3/3) [The description provides specific, actionable, and appropriate pest management recommendations, including regular scouting, use of economic thresholds to determine the need for chemical control, rotation of insecticide classes, and implementation of cultural practices such as early planting, use of trap crops, and maintaining field cleanliness. The recommendation to use an integrated pest management (IPM) approach is also relevant and well-justified.]
