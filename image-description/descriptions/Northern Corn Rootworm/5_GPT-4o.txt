The pest in the image is a Southern Corn Rootworm, identifiable by its distinctive green coloration and black-striped pattern on its back. The Southern Corn Rootworm is known for attacking corn crops, and based on the damage seen in the image, it is evident that this pest is feeding on the foliage of the plant. The leaf shows significant signs of feeding damage, such as irregular holes and jagged edges, indicating active and ongoing infestation.

This feeding damage can reduce the plant's photosynthetic capacity, leading to potentially stunted growth and decreased yield. Additionally, severe infestations may weaken the plant, making it more susceptible to other diseases and stress factors.

To manage and control Southern Corn Rootworm infestations, it is recommended to implement an integrated pest management (IPM) approach. This could include using crop rotation to break the pest's life cycle, planting resistant corn varieties, and monitoring pest populations with traps to determine action thresholds. In cases where chemical control is necessary, applying targeted insecticides such as pyrethroids or neonicotinoids can help manage the pest population. Always follow the recommended guidelines for pesticide application to minimize environmental impact and resistance development. Regular scouting of fields and maintaining good field hygiene can significantly help in preventing future infestations.
