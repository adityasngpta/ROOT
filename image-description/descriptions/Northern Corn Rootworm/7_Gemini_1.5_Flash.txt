The image shows a close-up of a corn plant with significant damage caused by a **Western Corn Rootworm** infestation. The larvae of this pest are feeding on the roots of the corn plant, resulting in visible wilting and stunting of the plant. The leaves are yellowing and drying out, indicating a lack of water and nutrients due to the root damage. Additionally, the corn stalk itself shows signs of weakness and is likely to break easily due to the rootworm's feeding activity. This infestation can significantly impact yield as the corn plant is unable to grow and produce healthy cobs. 

To manage this infestation, farmers should consider implementing a combination of control measures. **Rotating crops** is crucial to disrupt the rootworm's life cycle and prevent them from building up in the soil. **Planting resistant corn varieties** that are specifically bred to withstand rootworm damage can also be effective. **Insecticide application** may be necessary in severe cases, but it's important to choose a product specifically labeled for rootworm control and follow label instructions carefully.  Furthermore, monitoring the field regularly for signs of infestation and implementing a timely response is crucial for preventing widespread damage.
