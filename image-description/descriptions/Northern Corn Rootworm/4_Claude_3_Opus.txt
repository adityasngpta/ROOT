Based on the image provided, the pest appears to be a Cloverworm. The small, grayish-brown beetle can be seen resting on the yellow petals of what looks like a flower, likely a species in the Asteraceae family such as a chrysanthemum or dahlia.

The Cloverworm is known to feed on various legumes and other plants, potentially causing damage to the foliage. While the flower in the image seems to be in relatively good condition, with vibrant yellow petals, it's important to monitor the plant closely for signs of further infestation or leaf damage.

To manage a Cloverworm infestation, several steps can be taken. First, regularly inspect plants for the presence of the pest and remove any affected leaves or plant parts. Encouraging natural predators, such as birds and beneficial insects like ladybugs and lacewings, can help control the population. If the infestation becomes severe, the use of insecticidal soaps or neem oil may be necessary. However, it's crucial to follow the product instructions carefully and avoid applying them during the day when pollinators are active.

To prevent future infestations, maintain good plant health through proper watering, fertilization, and pruning practices. Remove any debris or weeds around the plants that may serve as hiding spots for the pests. Companion planting with repellent herbs like basil, mint, or rosemary can also help deter Cloverworms and other pests.
