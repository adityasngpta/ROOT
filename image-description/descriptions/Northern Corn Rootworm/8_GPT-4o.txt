The image displays a Southern Corn Rootworm on a leaf. Southern Corn Rootworm, commonly known as the spotted cucumber beetle, is identifiable by its greenish-yellow body and dark markings. The leaf in the image appears to be relatively healthy; however, Southern Corn Rootworms can cause significant harm to crops. The larvae typically feed on the roots of corn plants, leading to reduced nutrient uptake and making the plant more susceptible to lodging, where the plant falls over due to weak roots. Adult beetles feed on leaves, silks, and pollen, which can further reduce plant health and yield.

To manage and control this pest infestation, it is essential to monitor the fields for early signs of damage and the presence of beetles. Crop rotation can effectively reduce the population of Southern Corn Rootworms, as they tend to lay eggs in cornfields. Chemical control options include using soil-applied insecticides at planting or applying foliar insecticides when economic thresholds are reached. Integrating pest management approaches, such as using Bt corn varieties that provide resistance to rootworm damage, can also be beneficial. Regular field scouting and timely intervention can help minimize economic losses due to Southern Corn Rootworm infestations.
