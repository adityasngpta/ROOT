In the image you've provided, we see a pest identified as the Northern Corn Rootworm (Diabrotica barberi) located on a soybean leaf. This identification is based on the beetle's distinctive green color and overall morphology, which are characteristics of the Northern Corn Rootworm, although visually it closely resembles its counterpart, the Western Corn Rootworm.

The health of the soybean plant shown in the image seems to be fairly good overall, with some early signs of potential stress or minimal feeding damage visible on the leaves. Northern Corn Rootworms typically pose a greater threat to corn crops, where larval stages feed on roots causing significant damage, but adults can migrate and feed on the foliage of nearby soybeans, which seems to be happening here albeit with limited visible impact at this stage.

For managing Northern Corn Rootworm in soybeans, the primary concern is usually with respect to crop rotation rather than treatment of soybeans directly. Since these beetles are more problematic for corn, rotating soybeans with corn can help disrupt the life cycle of the rootworm. Should this pest be identified in corn, more aggressive management including the use of pesticides approved for rootworm control, genetically modified rootworm-resistant corn varieties, and careful monitoring of adult beetle populations for signs of resistance might be required.

If the beetle populations increase or if you are practicing crop rotation with corn, consider soil-applied insecticides or seed treatments for corn to prevent larvae from causing root damage. Continued scouting and monitoring are advisable to
