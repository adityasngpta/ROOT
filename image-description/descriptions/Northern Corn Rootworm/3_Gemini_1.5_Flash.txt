The image shows a close-up view of a corn plant, revealing the presence of a **Northern Corn Rootworm** larva. The larva, a cream-colored grub with a distinct brown head, is visible in the soil at the base of the corn stalk. The corn plant itself appears healthy and green, but the presence of the rootworm larva is a concerning sign. These larvae feed on the roots of the corn plant, causing damage that can significantly impact its growth and development. The damage done by the larvae is not readily visible in the image, as it occurs underground. However, the presence of the larva suggests that the plant's roots may be compromised, potentially leading to stunted growth, wilting, and reduced yield. To manage this infestation, the farmer should consider applying an insecticide labeled for corn rootworm control, preferably before the larvae hatch. Additionally, planting resistant corn varieties and rotating crops can help to reduce the risk of future infestations.
