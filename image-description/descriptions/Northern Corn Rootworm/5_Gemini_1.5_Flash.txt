The image shows a close-up of a corn plant with visible damage caused by a **Western Corn Rootworm** infestation. The adult beetles, characterized by their distinctive reddish-brown color and black markings, are present on the leaves. The plant itself displays signs of stress, with wilting leaves and a general decline in overall health.  This damage is likely the result of the larvae feeding on the roots, causing stunting and hindering the plant's ability to absorb water and nutrients.  The Western Corn Rootworm is a significant pest of corn, and its feeding activities can lead to substantial yield losses.  To manage this infestation, farmers should consider using an insecticide treatment targeting the larvae in the soil.  Additionally, preventative measures like crop rotation with non-corn crops and the use of resistant corn varieties can help reduce the risk of future infestations.
