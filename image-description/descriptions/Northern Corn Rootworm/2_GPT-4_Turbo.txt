The pest shown in the image you provided is a corn rootworm beetle, specifically the variant commonly known as the Northern Corn Rootworm (Diabrotica barberi) based on its size and coloring. This beetle is primarily green with a gold or tan hue, and you can see its long antennae, which are typical characteristics.

The beetle is located on a healthy-looking corn leaf, which is a good sign in terms of the overall plant health visible in this image. However, the presence of a Northern Corn Rootworm beetle is concerning because the larvae of this pest feed on corn roots, potentially causing significant damage. The adults, like the one in your photo, can damage silk and kernels if they are abundant.

To manage and control this pest, it’s crucial to consider integrated pest management strategies. Crop rotation is highly effective against Northern Corn Rootworm, since their larvae typically have only a single host crop, corn. Rotating corn with a non-host crop like soybean can disrupt their life cycle. Additionally, insecticides can be necessary if there are high beetle populations. Monitoring the adult population through traps can help determine the need for insecticide application. It’s also beneficial to avoid planting corn continuously in the same field, as this can lead to increased pest resistance and pressure.

Maintaining plant health and ensuring proper soil nutrition and moisture can also help the corn resist and recover from damage. Lastly, scouting fields regularly for rootworms and other pests enables timely actions to mitigate potential impacts on the
