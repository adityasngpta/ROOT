The image shows a close-up of a corn plant with significant damage caused by **Western Corn Rootworm** larvae. The corn plant's leaves are wilting and yellowing, indicating stress and potential nutrient deficiency. This is a classic symptom of rootworm feeding, as they damage the roots, hindering the plant's ability to absorb water and nutrients. The image also reveals small holes in the leaves, which are likely caused by the adult rootworms feeding on foliage.  These holes further contribute to the plant's stress and reduced photosynthesis. The damage to the roots and leaves could significantly impact the plant's growth and yield. To effectively manage this infestation, consider the following steps:

* **Monitoring:** Regularly check for rootworm activity by digging up a few plants and examining the roots for feeding damage.
* **Rotation:** Rotate crops annually to break the rootworm's life cycle. 
* **Insecticide Treatment:** Apply insecticide to the soil around the corn plants to target rootworm larvae. Be sure to use a product specifically labeled for corn rootworm control and follow the manufacturer's instructions carefully.
* **Resistant Varieties:** Plant corn varieties that exhibit resistance to Western Corn Rootworm. 

By taking these steps, farmers can help prevent significant crop losses and ensure a healthy corn harvest.
