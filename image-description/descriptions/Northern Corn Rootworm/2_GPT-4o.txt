The image depicts a Northern Corn Rootworm (Diabrotica barberi). Northern Corn Rootworms can cause significant damage to corn crops by feeding on the roots. The insect in the image is on a green leaf, indicating that the plant is likely still in a reasonably healthy condition. However, the presence of this pest suggests potential concerns for the plant's future health, as the larvae feed on the roots, restricting the plant's ability to absorb water and nutrients and making it more susceptible to lodging (falling over).

To manage an infestation of Northern Corn Rootworms, consider crop rotation as this disrupts their lifecycle. Using transgenic corn that expresses Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) proteins targeting rootworm larvae can also be effective. If relying on chemical treatments, soil insecticides or seed treatments at planting can help, along with foliar insecticides if adult beetles are present in large numbers. Monitoring adult beetle populations can guide the timing and need for treatment. Additionally, implementing integrated pest management strategies can reduce the likelihood of resistance developing to these control methods and ensure long-term sustainability of corn production.
