The image shows a green stink bug (Chinavia hilaris) on a leaf. This pest is identifiable by its green coloration and shield-shaped body. The leaf it is on exhibits several damage signs, such as small holes and sections of tissue eaten away. These indications, along with the presence of the stink bug, suggest that the pest is actively feeding on the plant's sap and damaging the leaf tissue.

The stink bug's impact on the crop includes piercing the plant tissues with their mouthparts to feed, which can result in the formation of blemishes on fruits and vegetables, deformation of plant parts, and overall reduced plant vigor. This damage can lead to a decrease in photosynthetic ability, weakening the plant.

To manage and control a stink bug infestation, it is recommended to monitor the crops regularly and manually remove any stink bugs that are found. In cases of severe infestation, applying insecticides such as products containing pyrethroids or neonicotinoids can be effective. Additionally, planting trap crops and encouraging natural predators like birds and beneficial insects can help manage the pest population. Crop rotation and maintaining field sanitation by removing plant debris can also prevent overwintering stink bugs from establishing and reducing future infestations.
