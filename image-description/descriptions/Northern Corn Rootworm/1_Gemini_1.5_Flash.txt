The image depicts a close-up view of a corn plant leaf, revealing a significant infestation of **Northern Corn Rootworm** larvae.  The larvae, which are cream-colored with dark heads, are clustered on the underside of the leaf, feeding on the leaf tissue. The leaf itself exhibits significant damage, showcasing numerous small, irregular holes and brown patches where the larvae have been feeding. This level of feeding damage can negatively impact the plant's ability to photosynthesize, potentially hindering growth and reducing yield.  The plant's overall health appears to be compromised, as the leaves are slightly wilted and yellowing, indicating potential stress from the infestation.  

To effectively manage this infestation, a multifaceted approach is recommended.  Initially, insecticide applications are advised to target the existing larvae and prevent further damage.  A soil insecticide treatment specifically targeting rootworm larvae is recommended for long-term control.  Additionally, crop rotation strategies, incorporating non-corn crops like soybeans or alfalfa, are crucial to disrupt the rootworm's life cycle.  Furthermore, monitoring for adult rootworm beetles in the field during the summer months and implementing control measures as needed can help prevent future infestations.  Finally, scouting for early signs of rootworm damage, such as wilting plants or leaf discoloration, is essential for timely intervention and minimizing the impact on yield.
