The image shows a Southern Corn Rootworm, recognizable by its greenish-yellow coloration and small size. This pest is known to cause significant damage to crops, particularly corn. The Southern Corn Rootworm larvae feed on the roots of the corn plant which can lead to stunted growth, weakened stalks, and reduced yields. In severe cases, plants may lodge, becoming unable to stand upright due to the compromised root system, which can make harvesting more difficult.

In this image, the health and condition of the leaf appear fair, but the presence of the Southern Corn Rootworm indicates potential underground damage to the corn plants. It's crucial to manage this pest to prevent extensive damage to the crop.

To control an infestation of Southern Corn Rootworm, farmers can employ several strategies. Crop rotation is effective in breaking the lifecycle of the rootworm as they tend to remain in the same field if not rotated. Using soil insecticides can help control larvae populations, and seed treatments with insecticides can protect young plants from larval feeding early in the season. Additionally, planting varieties of corn that are resistant to rootworms can be an effective long-term strategy. Monitoring fields regularly for signs of rootworm damage and using traps to gauge adult beetle populations can help in making timely and informed decisions about pest management.
