The pest in the image appears to be a Grape Colaspis, characterized by its small size and bright green coloration. This beetle typically feeds on various plants, including those in the grape family, which can significantly affect crop health. 

In terms of crop condition, the presence of the Grape Colaspis can lead to visible damage, such as skeletonizing of leaves, which compromises photosynthesis and weakens the overall vitality of the plant. The beetleâ€™s feeding habits can result in not only reduced yield but also increased susceptibility to disease.

To manage and control a Grape Colaspis infestation, it is recommended to regularly monitor crops, especially when they are young. Utilizing insecticidal soaps or neem oil can help to manage the population effectively. Additionally, implementing cultural practices such as crop rotation and maintaining healthy soil can reduce the risk of future infestations. Keeping the area clear of debris can also help minimize pest habitat. Implementing these strategies can help protect your crops and ensure better yield outcomes.
