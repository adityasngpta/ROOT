Based on the image provided, it appears that the pest is likely a Grape Colaspis. This small, bright yellow beetle is typically recognized by its smooth, shiny appearance and elongated body. The presence of this pest can be particularly detrimental to crop health, as Grape Colaspis larvae feed on the roots of plants, which can lead to stunted growth and reduced vigor. Visible damage from an infestation may include wilting, yellowing of the leaves, and overall decline in plant health, potentially resulting in notable yield loss.

To manage a Grape Colaspis infestation, it is important to monitor fields regularly, especially in early spring when the adults emerge. Integrated pest management strategies should include cultural practices, such as crop rotation and maintaining healthy soil, to help reduce pest populations. If warranted, insecticides targeting larvae may be effective, but it is crucial to follow label instructions and consider the impact on beneficial insects and the environment. Additionally, encouraging natural predators in the field can aid in controlling this pest population over time.
