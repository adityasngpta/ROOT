It appears there's been a bit of confusion with the image provided. The image you shared actually shows a frog camouflaged among the grass and leaves, rather than a pest that affects crops. Frogs are generally not pests in the agricultural sense; in fact, they can be beneficial as they typically eat insects and can help control populations of actual pests.

If you have images or concerns about specific insects or signs of damage on your crops, please share them. That would help in providing specific advice on pest management and potential treatments to protect your crops. Frogs, on the other hand, are beneficial to have in fields as part of a natural ecosystem, helping maintain a balance by preying on actual pest insects.
