The pests visible in the image are grasshoppers. Grasshoppers are significant agricultural pests, known for their capacity to cause extensive damage to crops. They feed on a variety of plants by chewing on the leaves, stems, and sometimes the roots. The plant in the background shows noticeable leaf damage that could be attributed to their feeding, such as missing portions of leaves and edges eaten away, which can significantly impact the plant's health and productivity. 

To manage and control a grasshopper infestation, you can implement several strategies. One method is to use insecticides that are specifically formulated for grasshoppers, such as those containing carbaryl, malathion, or permethrin. Another effective strategy is to manage the vegetation around crops to reduce the availability of food and shelter for grasshoppers, which can involve mowing surrounding areas or planting trap crops to attract the grasshoppers away from the main crop. Monitoring grasshopper populations early in the season can also help in applying controls before they reach levels that can cause significant damage. Lastly, biological control options, like introducing natural predators or using biopesticides derived from the fungus Nosema locustae, can be sustainable and effective over the long term. Maintaining a diverse and healthy ecosystem can also naturally keep grasshopper populations in check by supporting their predators.
