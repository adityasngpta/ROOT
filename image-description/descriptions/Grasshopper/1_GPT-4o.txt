The provided image is blurry, making it difficult to identify the pest with certainty. However, the blurred object in the image appears to be an insect in flight, distinguished by its wing structure and motion. Given the description and some visible characteristics, it could potentially be a moth or butterfly, as their rapid wing movement often leads to such blurry appearances in photos.

It is important to further analyze clearer images to confirm the exact type of pest. For precise identification and tailored pest management recommendations, I recommend capturing a clearer, focused image of the insect, preferably when it is stationary. Once accurately identified, a detailed pest management plan can be formulated.

In the interim, ensure to monitor your crops for other signs of pest damage, such as chewed leaves or stems, frass (insect excrement), or the presence of larvae, which would provide additional clues for identification and appropriate response. Regularly inspect your crops and take preventative measures, such as employing pheromone traps and implementing integrated pest management strategies, to minimize potential damage until a precise pest is identified.
