Based on the image provided, the pest present appears to be a Japanese Beetle (Popillia japonica). The distinctive metallic green body with copper-colored wing covers is a clear identifying feature of this species. The beetles are seen feeding on the foliage of what looks to be a fruit tree, possibly cherry or plum, causing significant damage to the leaves.

The leaves show extensive skeletonization, where the Japanese Beetles have consumed the soft tissue between the veins, leaving behind a lace-like appearance. This feeding damage can severely impact the plant's ability to photosynthesize effectively, leading to reduced growth and potential yield loss if the infestation is left unchecked.

To manage the Japanese Beetle infestation, a multi-pronged approach is recommended:

1. Manually remove and destroy the beetles: Handpick or knock the beetles into a container of soapy water in the early morning when they are less active.

2. Apply insecticides: Use a registered insecticide containing active ingredients such as carbaryl, pyrethroids, or neem oil. Follow label instructions carefully and reapply as needed.

3. Use traps: Deploy pheromone traps to capture adult beetles and reduce their population. Place traps away from the affected plants to avoid attracting more beetles to the area.

4. Encourage natural predators: Promote beneficial insects like parasitic wasps, ground beetles, and spiders that prey on Japanese Beetles.

5. Maintain plant health: Keep the trees well-watered and fertilized to help them withstand and recover from the feeding damage.

Implementing a combination of these methods can help control the Japanese Beetle population and minimize the damage to the fruit trees. Regularly monitor the plants for signs of infestation and take prompt action to prevent the problem from escalating.
