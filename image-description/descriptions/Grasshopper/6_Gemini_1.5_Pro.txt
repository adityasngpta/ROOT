There are no visible pests on the leaves, stems, or surrounding soil.  The overall appearance of the plant suggests that it is growing in favorable conditions. Since there is no evidence of pest presence, no specific recommendations for pest control are necessary at this time. However, it's always a good practice to continue monitoring crops for any signs of infestation or stress. Implementing integrated pest management strategies, such as scouting, crop rotation, and maintaining beneficial insect populations, can help prevent future pest problems and ensure healthy crop development.
