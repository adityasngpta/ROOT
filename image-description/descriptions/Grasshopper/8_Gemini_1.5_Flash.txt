The image shows a close-up of a corn plant with a **Northern Corn Rootworm** larva present. The larva is a creamy white color with a brown head and is clearly visible on the stalk of the corn plant. The corn plant itself appears to be in good health with healthy green leaves, but the larva's presence is a cause for concern. The Northern Corn Rootworm larva feeds on the roots of corn plants, causing damage that can stunt growth and reduce yield. The damage is not immediately visible in the image, but it is likely that the larva has already begun feeding on the plant's root system. To effectively manage this infestation, the farmer should consider using an insecticide specifically targeted at Northern Corn Rootworm larvae.  This should be applied at the appropriate time during the growing season, following label instructions to ensure proper application and minimize potential environmental impacts. Preventive measures include rotating crops to break the life cycle of the pest, planting resistant corn varieties, and maintaining healthy soil conditions to promote strong root growth. By addressing this issue proactively, the farmer can minimize potential yield losses and protect the health of their corn crop.
