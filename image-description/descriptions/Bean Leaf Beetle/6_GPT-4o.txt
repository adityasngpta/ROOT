The pest in the image is a Southern Corn Rootworm, also known as the Spotted Cucumber Beetle. This insect is identifiable by its yellowish-green color and distinctive black spots. The leaf it is on displays visible damage in the form of holes and surface scraping, which is typical of feeding by this beetle. As the larvae of the Southern Corn Rootworm feed on the roots of plants, they can cause significant damage to crops by compromising the root structure and nutrient uptake, leading to stunted growth and reduced yield. 

For managing an infestation of Southern Corn Rootworm, it is important to monitor the crop fields regularly and apply appropriate insecticides if the infestation exceeds economic thresholds. Crop rotation can help to break the life cycle of the beetles by depriving the larvae of their preferred host plants. Additionally, using soil treatments such as applying biological control agents or insecticidal seed treatments can help protect the crops from root damage caused by the larvae. Ensuring field hygiene by removing crop residues can also reduce overwintering sites for the adult beetles.
