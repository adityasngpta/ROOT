The pest in the image is a Southern Corn Rootworm, also known as the spotted cucumber beetle. It is easily identifiable by its yellowish-green body with twelve black spots on its elytra (wing covers). This beetle is sitting on a leaf showing signs of chew damage, indicating active feeding. The leaf has a rather significant hole, which suggests that the pest has been eating the plant material, potentially hindering the plant's ability to photosynthesize effectively and causing stress to the overall health of the plant.

Southern Corn Rootworm larvae can harm crops by attacking the roots, while adults target the foliage and can become a vector for plant diseases, further exacerbating the impact on crop health. For managing an infestation of Southern Corn Rootworm, it is crucial to adopt an integrated pest management approach. Monitoring adult beetle populations using yellow sticky traps can be effective for early detection. Cultural control methods, such as crop rotation and removing plant debris, can help reduce the pest's breeding sites. Chemical controls should be considered as a last resort due to potential environmental impacts; however, if necessary, using appropriate insecticides as directed by local agricultural extensions can provide control against severe infestations. Always be cautious about insecticide resistance and choose products that are effective against rootworms but still safe for the environment and non-target organisms.
