The image shows a Bean Leaf Beetle (Cerotoma trifurcata) on a soybean leaf. This small, oval-shaped beetle is easily identifiable by its light yellow to reddish-brown coloration with black spots on its wing covers. The background crop appears to be soybean plants, with visible green leaves that have a slightly fuzzy texture characteristic of soybean foliage.

The impact of the Bean Leaf Beetle on the crop is evident from the hole in the leaf, which is a typical feeding pattern for this pest. Bean Leaf Beetles chew round or oval holes in leaves, causing a lace-like appearance when infestations are severe. This damage can reduce photosynthetic capacity of the plant, potentially leading to yield loss if the infestation is widespread. Additionally, these beetles can transmit bean pod mottle virus, which can further impact crop health and yield.

To manage this pest, an integrated pest management (IPM) approach is recommended. Start by monitoring fields regularly, especially during early vegetative stages and again during pod development. If populations exceed economic thresholds (typically around 20% defoliation before bloom or 10% during pod fill), consider applying an insecticide. Pyrethroid insecticides are often effective against Bean Leaf Beetles. However, to prevent resistance, rotate insecticide classes if multiple applications are necessary. Cultural practices such as early planting and using resistant soybean varieties can also help manage populations. Additionally, maintaining field cleanliness by removing crop residues can reduce overwintering sites for the beetles. For long-term management, consider implementing crop rotation with non-host plants to disrupt the beetle's life cycle. Always follow local extension service recommendations for specific treatment options and application timing in your area.
