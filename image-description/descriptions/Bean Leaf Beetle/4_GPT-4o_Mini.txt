The pest in the image appears to be a Bean Leaf Beetle. This beetle features a distinct coloration with a shiny appearance and is typically characterized by yellow or tan bodies adorned with black markings. The background crop or plant shows a healthy green leaf, but there may be signs of damage from the beetle, which can result in notches or holes. This damage can impair photosynthesis and overall plant vigor, potentially leading to decreased yields.

To manage a Bean Leaf Beetle infestation, it's advisable to regularly monitor crops for these pests, especially during the seedling stage. If beetles are present, insecticides labeled for use on this pest can be applied, ensuring that they are safe for the crop and compliant with local regulations. Additionally, implementing crop rotation and proper sanitation practices can help prevent future outbreaks. Consider using resistant soybean varieties, as these can reduce the attractiveness of plants to the beetles. Taking these steps can help mitigate damage and protect crop health.
