The pest in the image you provided appears to be a Western Corn Rootworm beetle (Diabrotica virgifera virgifera). This species is easily identifiable by its distinctive yellow to light green body with black stripes along the wings. The Western Corn Rootworm is one of the most significant corn pests in North America, known for causing considerable damage primarily to corn crops but also to other crops when corn is not available.

This beetleâ€™s life cycle and feeding habits cause significant harm, primarily during its larval stage, where it feeds on the roots of corn plants, leading to reduced water and nutrient uptake and weakening the plant's overall stability. In severe infestations, this can lead to noticeable yield loss and can cause the plants to fall over (lodging). Adult beetles also contribute to crop damage by feeding on the corn silk and pollen, which can interfere with pollination and result in poorly filled ears of corn.

To manage an infestation of the Western Corn Rootworm effectively, consider the following strategies:
1. Crop rotation: Rotating away from corn to non-host crops like soybean, wheat, or other cereals can disrupt the pest's life cycle.
2. Use of BT corn: Planting corn varieties that express Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) toxins effective against rootworm larvae can reduce damage.
3. Soil insecticides: Applying approved soil insecticides at planting time can control larval populations.
4. Adult beetle management: Scouting and possibly applying
