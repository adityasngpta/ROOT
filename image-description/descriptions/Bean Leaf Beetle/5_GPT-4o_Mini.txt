The insect in the image appears to be a Grape Colaspis, which typically has a distinctive coloration with a combination of brown and black markings. This pest is known to cause damage primarily to various crops, particularly in the larval stage. If present in your fields, Grape Colaspis larvae feed on the roots of plants, leading to stunted growth, wilting, and increased susceptibility to diseases.

The overall health of the affected crop could decline significantly due to the feeding habits of this pest, potentially resulting in reduced yield. To manage a Grape Colaspis infestation, it's advisable to monitor the fields closely during the early stages of crop development for signs of larvae or damage. Utilizing crop rotation can help disrupt their life cycle, and the use of beneficial nematodes can be effective against larvae. If a chemical control is deemed necessary, consider using insecticides that are specifically labeled for Grape Colaspis and follow the application guidelines closely. Implementing these strategies can help mitigate the impact of this pest and preserve crop health.
