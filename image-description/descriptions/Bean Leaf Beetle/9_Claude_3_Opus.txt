Based on the image provided, the pest appears to be a Bean Leaf Beetle. The distinctive yellow and black striped pattern on the beetle's elytra (wing covers) is a clear identifying feature of this species.

The Bean Leaf Beetle is seen resting on what looks like a soybean leaf. The leaf itself has visible holes and damage, likely caused by the feeding activity of the beetle. Bean Leaf Beetles are known to chew small, round holes in soybean leaves, which can reduce the plant's photosynthetic capacity and overall health if the infestation is severe.

While the image only shows a single beetle, it's important to scout the field for more extensive damage and larger populations. Bean Leaf Beetles can cause significant yield loss if left unmanaged, particularly during the early growth stages of soybeans.

To control Bean Leaf Beetles, farmers should consider a combination of strategies:

1. Monitor fields regularly for signs of damage and presence of beetles, especially during the early season.

2. Use insecticide treatments if the economic threshold for damage is reached. Consult local extension services for specific recommendations on products and timing.

3. Employ crop rotation to non-host crops to break the beetle's life cycle and reduce populations in subsequent soybean plantings.

4. Consider planting later in the season to avoid peak beetle activity, if this aligns with other management practices and crop requirements.

5. Encourage natural predators, such as birds and beneficial insects, which can help control Bean Leaf Beetle populations.

By accurately identifying the Bean Leaf Beetle and implementing a timely, integrated pest management approach, farmers can minimize the impact of this pest on their soybean crops and protect their yields.
