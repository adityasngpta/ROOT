The image shows a Cloverworm moth (Hypena scabra) resting on a green leaf. This pest is a common sight in soybean and alfalfa fields, though it can affect other legume crops as well. The moth itself is not directly harmful to the plants, but it lays eggs that hatch into larvae (caterpillars) which are the damaging stage of this pest. The background leaf appears to have some minor damage, visible as small holes or ragged edges, which is consistent with cloverworm feeding habits.

The plant in the image seems to be in relatively good health overall, with the leaf maintaining a vibrant green color. However, the presence of the cloverworm moth suggests that there may be larvae feeding on the crop, which could lead to more significant defoliation if left unchecked. Cloverworm larvae can cause extensive leaf damage, potentially reducing photosynthetic capacity and yield if infestations become severe.

To manage cloverworm infestations, it's important to regularly scout fields, especially during the vegetative and early reproductive stages of crop growth. Monitoring should focus on detecting larvae and assessing defoliation levels. If defoliation exceeds economic thresholds (typically around 30% before bloom or 20% between bloom and pod fill for soybeans), treatment may be necessary. Recommended control measures include the use of selective insecticides that target lepidopteran pests, such as pyrethroids or products containing Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt). It's crucial to follow local extension guidelines for specific product recommendations and application timing. Additionally, promoting natural enemy populations, such as parasitic wasps and predatory insects, can help keep cloverworm populations in check. Crop rotation and maintaining field cleanliness can also reduce the likelihood of severe infestations in subsequent growing seasons.
