The image shows a cloverworm, a type of moth which is typically known for its larval stage that feeds on various plants, including alfalfa, clover, and soybeans. The adult moth displayed in the image has a triangular or delta shape, with brownish coloration that serves well for camouflage.

The leaf where the cloverworm is perched shows signs of potential feeding damage, such as small holes or ragged edges, which are tell-tale signs of larval feeding. The health of the leaf looks relatively intact, but if the infestation is severe, it can lead to significant defoliation, causing stress to the plant and potentially reducing the yield. 

To manage a cloverworm infestation, it is essential to monitor the fields regularly for early detection of larvae. Control measures include the application of appropriate insecticides such as spinosad or Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) if larval counts exceed economic thresholds. Implementing crop rotation and planting resistant varieties can also help in mitigating future infestations. Moreover, encouraging natural predators like birds and beneficial insects can offer biological control against this pest.
