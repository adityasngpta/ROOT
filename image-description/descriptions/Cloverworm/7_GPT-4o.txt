The image depicts a moth resting on a leaf, which is likely a cloverworm moth. Cloverworms are pests that can significantly impact crops, particularly legumes such as soybeans.

Cloverworm larvae are known to feed on the foliage of crops, causing defoliation. The level of impact depends on the severity of the infestation. In this image, the background crop appears to be in relatively good health since no significant feeding damage is visible on the leaf where the moth is resting. However, it is crucial to monitor the crop for the presence of larvae, as they can cause considerable defoliation if left unmanaged.

For managing cloverworm infestations, it is recommended to scout fields regularly during the growing season to detect larvae early. If larvae are present and defoliation exceeds threshold levels (usually around 20-30% defoliation for soybeans), consider using insecticides such as pyrethroids or chlorantraniliprole-based products. Employing integrated pest management strategies, including encouraging natural predators like parasitoids or lady beetles, can also help control cloverworm populations. Crop rotation and cultivation practices can reduce over-wintering sites for the moths, thus minimizing future infestations.
