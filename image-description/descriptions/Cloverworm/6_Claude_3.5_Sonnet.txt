The image shows a Cloverworm moth resting on a green plant stem, likely in a soybean or alfalfa field. The moth appears dark brown or black in color, with a distinctive triangular shape when at rest. The surrounding foliage looks healthy and green, suggesting that the current infestation level may not be severe. However, it's important to note that the presence of adult moths indicates that there may be larvae (caterpillars) feeding on the crop, which can cause significant damage if left unchecked.

Cloverworms can cause substantial defoliation in soybean and alfalfa crops, leading to reduced photosynthesis and potentially impacting yield. While the plants in the image appear healthy, it's crucial to monitor the field closely for signs of larval feeding, such as holes in leaves or skeletonized foliage.

To manage this pest, it's recommended to first assess the level of infestation by scouting the field and counting the number of larvae per plant or per square foot. If the population exceeds economic thresholds (typically around 20 larvae per square foot in soybeans), consider implementing control measures. These may include the application of insecticides such as pyrethroids or carbamates. However, it's essential to choose products that are registered for use on the specific crop and follow all label instructions.

Additionally, cultural practices can help manage cloverworm populations. Encouraging natural predators like birds, parasitic wasps, and predatory insects can provide biological control. Crop rotation and early planting can also reduce the impact of cloverworm infestations. For long-term management, consider using resistant varieties of soybeans or alfalfa if available in your region. Regular monitoring throughout the growing season will be key to staying ahead of potential outbreaks and minimizing crop damage.
