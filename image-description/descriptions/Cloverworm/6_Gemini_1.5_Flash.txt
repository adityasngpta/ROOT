The image shows a close-up of a corn plant with a **Northern Corn Rootworm** adult beetle feeding on the leaves. The beetle is a light brown color with a distinct black spot on each wing cover. The corn plant appears to be in good health, with lush green leaves and a healthy stalk. However, the leaves show signs of damage caused by the beetle's feeding. The leaves have small, irregular holes, indicating that the beetle has been feeding on them. This feeding damage can impact the corn plant's ability to photosynthesize, potentially affecting yield and plant health. 

To manage this infestation, farmers should consider using an insecticide specifically labeled for Northern Corn Rootworm control. Since the beetles are currently feeding on the leaves, an insecticide with foliar activity would be most effective. Additionally, preventive measures can be implemented to reduce future infestations. This includes crop rotation to disrupt the rootworm's lifecycle, planting resistant corn hybrids, and using beneficial insects like parasitic wasps that prey on rootworm larvae. By taking a proactive approach to pest management, farmers can help minimize the impact of Northern Corn Rootworm on their corn crop and ensure a successful harvest.
