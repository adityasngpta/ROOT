The image shows a moth-like insect resting on what appears to be a mix of grass and broadleaf plants on a rocky surface. This insect resembles the adult form of the cloverworm, which is a common pest in agricultural settings. Adult cloverworm moths do not cause significant damage themselves; however, their larvae, which are caterpillar-like, cause substantial feeding damage to crops such as soybeans and other legumes. Cloverworm larvae feed on the leaves, causing defoliation which can lead to reduced photosynthesis and consequently, a decrease in crop yield.

The surrounding plants appear relatively healthy, though there may be some minor signs of leaf damage. This is typical in the early stages of infestation. To manage cloverworm infestations, farmers should regularly scout their fields during the growing season to detect the presence of larvae. If larval populations exceed economic thresholds, consider applying an appropriate insecticide labeled for cloverworm control, such as those containing active ingredients like lambda-cyhalothrin or bifenthrin. Additionally, promoting beneficial predatory insects and maintaining crop diversity can help reduce cloverworm populations naturally. Employing crop rotation and planting resistant crop varieties are other effective preventive measures.
