The image shows a corn plant with significant damage caused by a **Western Corn Rootworm** infestation. The plant's leaves are wilted and discolored, indicating a lack of water and nutrients. The main stem shows signs of girdling, with the characteristic feeding damage caused by the rootworm larvae. This girdling disrupts the plant's vascular system, preventing water and nutrients from reaching the upper parts of the plant. The plant's tassel is also affected, with signs of stunted growth and reduced pollen production. This damage can significantly impact yield potential by reducing the number of ears, kernel size, and overall grain production. To manage this infestation, the farmer should consider using a combination of cultural and chemical control methods. This could include rotating corn with non-host crops, planting resistant corn varieties, and applying insecticide treatments at the appropriate time. Additionally, monitoring for early signs of infestation is crucial to prevent widespread damage and ensure a healthy crop.
