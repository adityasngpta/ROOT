The image shows a close-up of a corn plant, revealing significant damage caused by a **Northern Corn Rootworm** infestation. The leaves are visibly skeletonized, with only the veins remaining intact, indicating the characteristic feeding pattern of this pest. The plant appears stressed and wilting, suggesting the rootworm's damage has impacted its ability to absorb water and nutrients. The presence of numerous small holes in the leaves further confirms the presence of the rootworm. While the image does not show the rootworm itself, the damage patterns are distinctive and highly indicative of its activity. 
 
To manage this infestation, a combination of strategies is recommended. **Treatment with an insecticide** targeting rootworm larvae would be necessary to control the current infestation. **Planting resistant corn varieties** can also help minimize future infestations. **Crop rotation** should be implemented, avoiding planting corn in the same field for consecutive years, as this disrupts the rootworm's lifecycle.  Finally, **monitoring for adult rootworms** during the growing season is essential for early detection and timely intervention to prevent further damage.
