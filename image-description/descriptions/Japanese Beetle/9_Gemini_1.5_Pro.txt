The image depicts a healthy soybean plant with no visible signs of pests or diseases. The leaves are a vibrant green color with no noticeable discoloration, holes, or deformities. There is no evidence of insect feeding, webbing, or egg masses. The overall appearance of the soybean plant suggests healthy growth and development. Therefore, I cannot identify any pests in this image and no action is required.  However, it is always a good practice to regularly scout your fields for any signs of pests or diseases to ensure early detection and timely management.
