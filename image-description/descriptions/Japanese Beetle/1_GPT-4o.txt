The image depicts two Japanese beetles (Popillia japonica) on a leaf. Japanese beetles are a significant pest for a variety of crops, ornamentals, and turf grass. They can be identified by their metallic green bodies and copper-brown wing covers. The leaf on which they are situated shows signs of damage, exhibiting holes likely caused by the beetles' feeding. This type of damage, referred to as skeletonizing, occurs when beetles chew through the leaf tissue, leaving behind a lace-like structure of veins.

The presence of Japanese beetles can lead to substantial foliar damage, which reduces photosynthesis, weakens plants, and can cause a significant reduction in crop yield and quality. They are especially detrimental in high numbers as their larvae, white grubs, also feed on the roots of grasses and other plants, causing further harm.

To manage and control Japanese beetle infestations, several strategies can be employed. Hand-picking and drowning the beetles in soapy water can be effective for small infestations. For larger populations, applying insecticidal sprays containing active ingredients like carbaryl, bifenthrin, or imidacloprid can reduce their numbers. Additionally, using pheromone traps can lure and capture adult beetles, although care must be taken to place these traps away from crops to prevent attracting more beetles toward the plants. Preventative measures include applying beneficial nematodes or milky spore powder to the soil to target larvae and reduce future
