The image shows a close-up of a corn plant with a clear infestation of **Western Corn Rootworm** larvae. The larvae are visible as small, white grubs, with distinct brown heads, burrowed into the roots of the corn plant. The roots appear damaged and frayed, indicating that the larvae have been feeding heavily. The plant itself is exhibiting signs of stress, with the leaves turning yellow and wilting slightly. This suggests that the rootworm infestation is causing the plant to struggle to absorb water and nutrients. The damage to the roots and the overall stressed appearance of the plant indicate a potential for significant yield loss.  

To manage this infestation, farmers should consider a combination of approaches. **Early detection** is crucial, and scouting fields regularly is recommended. **Rotation** with non-corn crops can disrupt the rootworm lifecycle and reduce their population.  **Insecticide application** targeting rootworm larvae can also be effective. There are several insecticide options available, including granular formulations applied at planting or in-furrow, as well as foliar sprays. **Biocontrol** options, such as beneficial nematodes, can be incorporated to target rootworm larvae. Farmers should carefully consider the specific needs of their field and choose the most appropriate management strategy based on factors such as crop variety, infestation severity, and environmental conditions.
