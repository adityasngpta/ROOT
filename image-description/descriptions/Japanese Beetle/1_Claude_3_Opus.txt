Based on the image provided, the pest appears to be a Japanese Beetle (Popillia japonica). The beetle has a distinctive metallic green head and thorax with copper-colored wing covers. Its oval-shaped body is approximately 15mm in length.

The Japanese Beetle is seen resting on a green leaf, likely from the affected plant or crop. While the image doesn't show extensive damage, Japanese Beetles are known to feed on a wide variety of plants, including leaves, flowers, and fruits. Their feeding habits can result in skeletonized leaves, where only the veins remain, ultimately reducing the plant's ability to photosynthesize and grow properly.

To manage a Japanese Beetle infestation, a multi-pronged approach is recommended:

1. Manually remove and destroy the beetles: Handpick or knock the beetles into a container of soapy water early in the morning when they are less active.

2. Use row covers: Protect vulnerable plants by covering them with fine mesh or fabric barriers to prevent the beetles from accessing them.

3. Employ traps: Place Japanese Beetle traps at the perimeter of the affected area to capture and reduce the population. Be cautious, as traps can sometimes attract more beetles to the area.

4. Apply insecticides: In cases of severe infestation, consider using insecticides containing active ingredients such as carbaryl, permethrin, or pyrethrins. Always follow label instructions and consider the impact on beneficial insects.

5. Maintain plant health: Keep plants well-watered and fertilized to help them withstand and recover from beetle damage.

Implementing a combination of these methods and monitoring the plants regularly can help manage Japanese Beetle infestations and minimize their impact on the affected plants or crops.
