The image depicts a close-up view of a corn plant with significant damage caused by a **Western Corn Rootworm** infestation. The plant exhibits multiple feeding holes in the leaves, indicating the characteristic feeding behavior of this pest. Several adult Western Corn Rootworm beetles are visible, showcasing their metallic-bronze coloration and distinctive elongated body shape. Additionally, there is evidence of root damage, likely caused by the larval stage of the Western Corn Rootworm, which feeds on the roots of corn plants. The overall health of the corn plant appears compromised due to the extensive feeding damage, potentially impacting its growth and yield potential. 

To effectively manage this infestation, it is recommended to implement an integrated pest management approach. This may include utilizing resistant corn varieties, practicing crop rotation, and applying insecticides. Insecticide application should be timed to target the larval stage of the Western Corn Rootworm during the early stages of plant growth. Furthermore, monitoring the crop regularly for signs of infestation and implementing preventative measures such as soil cultivation and timely planting can help reduce the chances of future outbreaks.
