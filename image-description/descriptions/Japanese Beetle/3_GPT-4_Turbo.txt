The beetle in the image appears to be a Japanese Beetle, a common pest in agricultural settings, particularly known for its metallic green and coppery-brown elytra (wing coverings). This beetle is identified by its distinctive shiny, metallic appearance and the tufts of white hair along the sides and rear of its abdomen.

Japanese Beetles are notorious for their ability to cause significant damage to a wide range of crops and plants. The feeding pattern typically appears as a skeletonization of the leaves, where the tissue between the veins is eaten, leaving a lacy or net-like structure. This can significantly reduce the plant's ability to photosynthesize, leading to stunted growth and reduced yields.

The health of the plant in the background appears to be compromised, likely beginning to suffer from the early stages of this beetleâ€™s feeding activity. To manage an infestation of Japanese Beetles, it's critical to act quickly as they tend to attract more beetles to the area. Management strategies include hand-picking the beetles off plants in the early morning or late evening when they are less active, and disposing of them in a bucket of soapy water. Additionally, the use of floating row covers can protect plants during the peak feeding times, although this may not be feasible for large crops. Chemical control options include using insecticides that are specifically labeled for Japanese Beetle control; however, care should be taken to follow all label recommendations to avoid damage to beneficial insects and the surrounding environment.
