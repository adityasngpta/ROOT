The pest observed in the image is a Japanese Beetle. This beetle is a common agricultural pest known for its distinctive metallic green and copper-colored body. The leaves of the plant show signs of feeding damage typical of Japanese Beetles, which includes skeletonizing the leaves by consuming the tissue between the veins, leaving a lace-like appearance. This type of damage can significantly impact the health of the plant, as severe defoliation reduces the plantâ€™s ability to photosynthesize efficiently, leading to possible reductions in growth and yield. 

To manage or control an infestation of Japanese Beetles, consider the following recommendations: 

1. **Handpicking**: For small infestations, manually removing the beetles early in the morning when they are less active can be effective. Dropping them into a bucket of soapy water will kill them quickly.
2. **Insecticide Application**: If the infestation is severe, applying insecticides such as carbaryl, imidacloprid, or pyrethroids can help control adult beetles. Always follow label instructions and consider the impact on beneficial insects.
3. **Trapping**: Although pheromone traps are available, they may attract more beetles to the area and are generally not recommended unless used far from crop areas.
4. **Biological Controls**: Using natural predators like nematodes or parasitic wasps that target Japanese Beetle larvae can help reduce beetle populations over time.

Preventive measures include maintaining healthy, diverse plantings
