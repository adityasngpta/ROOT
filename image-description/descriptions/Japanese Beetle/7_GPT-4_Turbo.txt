The pest in the image you've provided is a Japanese Beetle. This beetle is easily recognizable by its metallic green head and thorax, and copper-colored elytra (wing covers). Its size typically ranges from 8 to 11 mm in length and it has tufts of white hair along the sides of its abdomen.

Japanese Beetles are known to feed on a wide range of plants, over 300 species, including several ornamentals, vegetables, and crops. The beetle in the image is shown on a leaf, which exhibits minor chew marks around the edges, consistent with the feeding pattern of Japanese Beetles. They generally chew through leaf tissue, leaving behind the veinsâ€”a type of damage known as skeletonization.

The presence of Japanese Beetles can lead to significant damage to crops if not managed properly. They have the potential to reduce the photosynthetic ability of plants, weaken them, and could eventually lead to reduced yields. 

To manage Japanese Beetle infestations, consider the following strategies:
1. Physical removal: Collecting beetles by hand or with a small vacuum in the early morning when they are less active can be effective on a small scale.
2. Traps: Commercially available pheromone traps attract and capture adults, but they should be placed at a distance from the main area to avoid drawing more beetles into the crop.
3. Chemical control: If beetle numbers are high, the application of insecticides specific to adult beetles may be necessary. Always
