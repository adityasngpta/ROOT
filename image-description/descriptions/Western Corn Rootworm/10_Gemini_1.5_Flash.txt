The image shows a close-up of a corn plant with significant damage caused by a **Western Corn Rootworm** infestation.  The leaves are heavily chewed and riddled with holes, indicating the characteristic feeding behavior of this pest. The damage is concentrated at the base of the plant, which is a key indicator of rootworm activity as they feed on the roots, causing stunted growth and weakening the plant. Additionally, the presence of small, white larvae, which are characteristic of Western Corn Rootworms, can be seen on the leaves. The plant's overall health appears compromised due to the extensive damage, suggesting a potential yield loss if the infestation is not controlled.  

To effectively manage this infestation, farmers should consider a combination of strategies. Firstly, rotating crops is essential to disrupt the life cycle of the rootworm. Planting corn in the same field for consecutive years encourages rootworm populations to thrive, so rotating with non-host crops, such as soybeans or alfalfa, is crucial. Secondly, insecticide applications can effectively control adult rootworms and larvae, with products containing active ingredients like imidacloprid or clothianidin proving effective. Finally, using resistant corn varieties can also provide a barrier against rootworm damage, offering an additional layer of protection.
