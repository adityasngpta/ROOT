Based on the image provided, the pest appears to be a Western Corn Rootworm beetle. The beetle has the distinctive yellow and black striped pattern on its wing covers that is characteristic of this species.

The beetle is seen resting on what looks to be a corn leaf, given the long, slender shape and parallel veins of the leaf in the background. The leaf surface appears healthy and undamaged, with no obvious signs of feeding injury or discoloration that would indicate stress from the rootworm infestation.

However, the presence of the adult Western Corn Rootworm is concerning because the larvae of this pest feed on corn roots, which can lead to significant damage and yield loss if left uncontrolled. The adults lay eggs in the soil that hatch into larvae the following season, perpetuating the infestation cycle.

To manage Western Corn Rootworm, farmers should consider a combination of strategies:

1. Crop rotation to non-host crops like soybeans can disrupt the pest's life cycle and reduce populations.

2. Planting corn hybrids with built-in resistance to rootworm feeding (Bt traits) can minimize damage.

3. Applying soil insecticides at planting or during early larval stages can suppress populations.

4. Monitoring adult beetle populations with sticky traps can help guide treatment decisions.

5. Implementing cultural practices like proper fertilization and irrigation can promote vigorous root growth and tolerance to feeding damage.

By scouting fields regularly, identifying pests like Western Corn Rootworm early, and adopting an integrated management approach, farmers can protect their corn crop from yield-robbing damage and ensure a successful harvest.
