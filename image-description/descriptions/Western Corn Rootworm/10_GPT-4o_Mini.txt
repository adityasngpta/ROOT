The pest in the image appears to be a Northern Corn Rootworm, identifiable by its elongated body and distinctive coloration, often characterized by a predominately green or yellow hue with dark markings. This pest is commonly found on corn plants, particularly in the tassel area. The condition of the corn plant may indicate stress, as rootworms can lead to significant damage, particularly to the roots and ears. They can cause reduced yield and poor ear development due to their feeding habits. 

Visible damage from Northern Corn Rootworm includes loss of plant vigor, yellowing of leaves, and potential tipping or lodging of the stalks due to weakened root systems. To manage this infestation, consider implementing integrated pest management strategies, which may include planting resistant corn hybrids, using crop rotation to disrupt the pest's lifecycle, and applying targeted insecticides if thresholds are exceeded. Regular monitoring and scouting for signs of pests are also recommended to catch infestations early and minimize impact on crop yield.
