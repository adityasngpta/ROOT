The image depicts a healthy soybean plant with signs of defoliation evident in the holes present throughout the leaves. This type of damage is characteristic of Japanese Beetles. These beetles are voracious feeders and can cause significant damage to plants, particularly to the leaves, by skeletonizing them. While the soybean plant in the image does not appear to be severely damaged yet, it's crucial to monitor for increasing pest populations and potential further damage.  To manage this infestation, I recommend using a two-pronged approach. First, consider applying a registered insecticide targeting Japanese Beetles.  Second, implement preventative measures for the future, such as introducing beneficial nematodes to the soil, which are natural predators of Japanese Beetle larvae.  Additionally, consider planting trap crops like roses or grapes at a distance from the soybean field to lure the beetles away.
