The insect in the image is a Northern Corn Rootworm beetle (Diabrotica barberi). Characteristic features of this pest include its pale greenish-yellow body with a darker green line down the center of its wing covers. This adult beetle is typically observed on corn plants, as seen in the image where it is perched on a corn leaf.

The Northern Corn Rootworm is a significant pest in maize cultivation. Adult beetles typically feed on the foliage and pollen of corn, while their larvae are more damaging as they feed on the roots, which can lead to reduced water and nutrient uptake by the plant. Some signs of damage visible in the image include speckled holes and chewed areas along the leaf, indicating adult feeding activity.

To manage an infestation of Northern Corn Rootworm, a variety of approaches should be considered. Rotating crops with non-host plants like soybean or wheat can break the pest's life cycle by eliminating the corn roots needed for larval development. Soil insecticides at planting time can be effective against larvae if used judiciously. Additionally, planting corn varieties that are resistant to rootworm can help reduce damage. Monitoring adult beetle populations can guide decisions about the need for control measures in subsequent seasons. It is also beneficial to clean up plant debris after harvest to reduce overwintering habitats for the pests.
