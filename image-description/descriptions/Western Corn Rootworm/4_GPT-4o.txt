The insect pictured is a Western Corn Rootworm, a significant pest for corn crops. This beetle can cause substantial damage to corn plants. The primary impact of the Western Corn Rootworm is on the root system of the corn plants, which can lead to reduced water and nutrient uptake, potentially resulting in stunted growth, lodging (where plants are knocked over), and significant yield loss. The adult beetles also feed on corn silks, which can interfere with pollination and further reduce yields.

The leaf in the image shows signs of feeding damage, with noticeable ragged edges where the beetle has been eating. To manage this pest, crop rotation is highly effective, as the larvae need corn roots for development. Chemical control using soil-applied insecticides or seed treatments can also be beneficial, especially in fields with a history of heavy infestations. Additionally, planting hybrids with rootworm resistance traits can help minimize damage. Monitoring and timely intervention are crucial to protect the crop effectively from the Western Corn Rootworm.
