The insect in the provided image is a Northern Corn Rootworm, identifiable by its distinctive greenish-yellow coloring and parallel black lines running down its back. This beetle is a common pest in cornfields and can significantly impact the health of corn crops.

This particular beetle is shown on the edge of a corn leaf, which itself appears relatively healthy from this close angle, though any presence of rootworms can lead to more severe issues beneath the surface. Northern Corn Rootworms primarily damage corn crops by their larval feeding on roots, which can cause the plants to become unstable, leading to "goose necking," and potentially decreased water and nutrient uptake.

To manage an infestation of Northern Corn Rootworms, it's essential to practice crop rotation as rootworms typically lay eggs in cornfields and the larvae are dependent on corn roots for nourishment upon hatching. Rotating to a non-corn crop can disrupt their lifecycle. Additionally, the use of soil-applied insecticides or seed treatments with approved insecticides can assist in reducing rootworm damage. Farmers should also consider using corn varieties that are genetically engineered to resist rootworms. It's crucial for continued monitoring of the field to assess pest control effectiveness and adjust management strategies accordingly.
