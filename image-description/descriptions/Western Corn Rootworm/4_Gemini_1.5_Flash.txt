The image shows a close-up of a corn plant with visible damage caused by a **Western Corn Rootworm**.  The damage is characterized by irregular holes in the leaves, suggesting feeding from the larvae of the Western Corn Rootworm. The corn plant itself appears to be in a healthy state, with vibrant green leaves and a sturdy stalk. However, the feeding activity of the rootworm larvae can significantly impact the plant's health in the long term, leading to stunted growth and reduced yield. The larvae feed on the roots, weakening the plant's ability to absorb nutrients and water, ultimately hindering its overall growth and productivity.  

To manage this infestation, consider the following strategies: 

* **Insecticide Application:** Apply an insecticide labeled for Western Corn Rootworm control. Focus on the base of the plant to target the larvae in the soil. 
* **Crop Rotation:** Rotate corn with non-host crops, such as soybeans or alfalfa, to disrupt the life cycle of the rootworm. 
* **Resistant Varieties:** Utilize corn varieties that exhibit resistance to Western Corn Rootworm. 
* **Monitoring:** Regularly inspect your corn plants for signs of infestation and monitor the rootworm population throughout the growing season. Early detection is key for effective management. 
* **Biological Control:** Consider introducing beneficial insects, such as parasitic wasps, that prey on Western Corn Rootworm larvae.
