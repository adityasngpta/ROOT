The image shows a Western Corn Rootworm, identifiable by its distinctive yellow body with black stripes running longitudinally. This pest is a major concern for corn crops as it primarily feeds on corn roots during its larval stage, causing significant damage that can lead to reduced nutrient uptake, lodging, and ultimately yield loss. In the adult stage, the Western Corn Rootworm can also feed on corn silks, hindering pollination.

The leaf in the image appears to have slight edge chew marks, a typical sign of adult feeding. Although the immediate damage seen in the photo may be minor, the root-feeding larvae pose a more serious threat to the overall crop health.

For management, rotating crops is an effective strategy since this pest predominantly targets corn. Using resistant hybrids and applying insecticides can also help to control the infestation. In more severely affected areas, soil-applied insecticides at planting or a seed treatment with systemic insecticides can provide protection against rootworm larvae. Monitoring the field for adult beetles during the growing season is crucial to determine the need for foliar insecticide applications. Implementing an integrated pest management (IPM) approach ensures more sustainable control and helps mitigate resistance development in pest populations.
