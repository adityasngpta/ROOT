This image shows a corn leaf with a pest identified as the Western Corn Rootworm (Diabrotica virgifera virgifera). The Western Corn Rootworm beetle is recognized by its distinctive yellow-green coloration with black stripes running longitudinally down its elytra (wing covers).

The corn leaf in the image exhibits signs of moderate damage, which is typical of the feeding patterns of adult Western Corn Rootworms. These beetles generally feed on the leaves, creating small round holes and notched edges, which can be seen in the image. This type of damage can reduce photosynthetic area and potentially diminish the plant's ability to produce energy, impacting overall crop health and yield.

Management of Western Corn Rootworm includes several strategies. Crop rotation is effective as it disrupts the lifecycle of the pest, which typically lays eggs in corn soil and expects corn to be there the following season. In fields continuously planted with corn, using Bt corn varieties that express proteins toxic to the rootworm can reduce damage. Additionally, soil-applied insecticides or seed treatments can be used to protect seedlings and roots from larvae and adult feeding. Monitoring beetle populations through traps can help in making timely decisions regarding control measures. Itâ€™s crucial to integrate these control measures with good agricultural practices, such as residue management, to sustainably manage pest populations and reduce the likelihood of resistance build-up.
