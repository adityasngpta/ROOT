The image depicts a healthy soybean plant with signs of defoliation, characterized by irregular holes and missing tissue on the leaves. The culprit behind this damage is the **Bean Leaf Beetle**. These beetles are small, about Â¼ inch long, and can vary in color.  While they may be yellow, tan, or red, they are easily identifiable by their black markings: two black spots on the back of their wings and a prominent black triangle at the top of their wing covers.  Bean leaf beetles directly impact soybean yield by feeding on the leaves, reducing the plant's ability to photosynthesize effectively. 

To manage bean leaf beetle infestations, consider an integrated pest management approach. Scout fields regularly throughout the season to monitor populations. If defoliation reaches 20% before flowering or 30% during pod development, consider applying an insecticide.  Neem oil and insecticidal soaps can be effective for smaller infestations.  Cultural practices such as crop rotation, delayed planting, and tillage can help disrupt their lifecycle and minimize overwintering populations.  Planting resistant soybean varieties can also be an effective long-term strategy for managing bean leaf beetle populations.
