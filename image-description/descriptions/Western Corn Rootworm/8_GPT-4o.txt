The image depicts a Northern Corn Rootworm beetle on a leaf. The Northern Corn Rootworm is identifiable by its yellow-green body with dark stripes running lengthwise. The leaf in the image shows signs of pest activity, with visible discoloration and minor holes, indicating feeding damage. 

The impact of the Northern Corn Rootworm on crops is significant, especially for corn plants. The larvae primarily target corn roots, causing root pruning, which leads to stunted growth, reduced water and nutrient uptake, and increased susceptibility to lodging, where the plants may fall over. The adult beetles feed on corn silks, which can interfere with pollination and ultimately reduce yield.

To manage a Northern Corn Rootworm infestation, crop rotation is one of the most effective strategies, as the pests are heavily reliant on corn. Planting non-host crops like soybeans can break the pest's life cycle. Additionally, the use of insecticides can be considered for both larvae and adults. Soil-applied insecticides or seed treatments can target larvae, while foliar sprays can help control adult populations during the critical silk period. Monitoring for pest levels and employing integrated pest management (IPM) practices will aid in minimizing the impact on crop yields.
