The image depicts a healthy soybean plant with no visible signs of pest infestation. The leaves are vibrant green with no holes, discoloration, or curling that might indicate feeding damage. Additionally, the overall structure of the plant appears robust and healthy. With no evidence of pests in the image, it is impossible to determine which, if any, are impacting the crop.  Since no pests are present, no recommendations for pest management are needed at this time. However, it is always advisable for farmers to regularly scout their fields for early signs of infestation to prevent potential yield loss.
