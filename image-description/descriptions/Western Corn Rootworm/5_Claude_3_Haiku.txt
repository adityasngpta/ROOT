The image shows a small insect pest resting on a green leaf. Based on the elongated body shape and antennae, this appears to be a Dectes Stem Borer. The Dectes Stem Borer is a pest that infests soybean and sunflower crops, tunneling into the plant stems and causing significant damage.

In this case, the Dectes Stem Borer is present on a healthy, green leaf, indicating it has likely infested the surrounding crop. The presence of this pest can lead to wilting, lodging, and reduced yields in soybean and sunflower plants. Left uncontrolled, a Dectes Stem Borer infestation can cause substantial economic losses for farmers.

To manage this pest, I would recommend the following:

- Closely monitor the crop for signs of Dectes Stem Borer activity, such as wilting plants or stem tunneling.
- Consider using an insecticide treatment targeted at the Dectes Stem Borer, such as a pyrethroid or neonicotinoid product. Time applications to target the adult beetles before they lay eggs.
- Implement cultural control methods like crop rotation and destruction of crop residues to remove overwintering sites for the pest.
- Consider planting soybean or sunflower varieties that are less susceptible to Dectes Stem Borer damage.

Proactive and integrated pest management strategies are key to effectively controlling Dectes Stem Borer infestations and protecting crop yields. I hope these recommendations provide a helpful starting point for addressing this pest issue.
