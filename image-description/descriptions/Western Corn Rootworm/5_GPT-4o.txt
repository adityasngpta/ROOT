The pest shown in the image is the Northern Corn Rootworm. This insect is characterized by its yellowish-green body and black spots or stripes along its back. The crop in the background appears to be a corn plant, as indicated by the texture and color of the leaf.

Northern Corn Rootworm beetles primarily feed on corn silks, tassels, and occasionally the leaves, which may lead to insufficient pollination and ultimately reduce the yield. Additionally, the Rootworm larvae cause significant damage to corn roots, leading to poor nutrient and water uptake, lodging, and overall stunted growth of the plants.

To manage and control an infestation of Northern Corn Rootworm, it is recommended to rotate crops to break the pest's life cycle, as they primarily target corn. Insecticides may also be used; options include soil-applied insecticides at planting or foliar sprays targeting the adult beetles during their emergence. Genetically modified corn varieties that express proteins toxic to the rootworm larvae can also be an effective preventive measure. Additionally, monitoring and scouting for early detection can help in applying timely and appropriate control measures.
