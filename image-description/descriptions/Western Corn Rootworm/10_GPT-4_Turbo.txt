The pest visible in the image is the Western Corn Rootworm beetle. This beetle can be identified by its yellowish body with characteristic black stripes along the elytra (wing covers). The Western Corn Rootworm is a major pest of corn crops and is notorious for the damage it can cause to the roots of corn plants during its larval stage, which can significantly impact crop yield and health. In its adult form, as shown in the image, it tends to feed on the foliage and may also damage the silk, which interferes with pollination.

The background of the image shows the beetle on a silken part of a plant, likely corn silk, which is indicative of potential damage to the reproductive parts of the crop. The silk looks disturbed and slightly damaged, which may lead to poor kernel development if pollination is adversely affected.

To manage Western Corn Rootworm, it is recommended to practice crop rotation as the larvae tend to thrive in fields where corn is planted year after year. Moreover, the use of insecticide-treated seeds or soil-applied insecticides can help control larval populations. In areas with heavy infestations, adult population control through foliar sprays may be necessary. Monitoring the pest levels through traps and field scouting is crucial to determine the need for and timing of interventions, thus preventing unnecessary pesticide use and reducing the likelihood of the pest developing resistance.
