The pest shown in the image is a Western Corn Rootworm beetle. This beetle is easily identifiable by its distinctive yellow and black striped elytra (wing covers) and a black head and thorax. The Western Corn Rootworm is a significant pest in agricultural contexts, particularly in fields of corn.

In the image, the beetle appears to be on a leaf, which shows some feeding damage typical of this pest. This includes small holes and irregular notches along the leaf edges, indicative that the beetle has been eating the leaf tissue. Such feeding can weaken plants but is generally less harmful than the damage caused by their larvae, which feed on corn roots and can cause more severe issues including reduced water and nutrient uptake, and increased susceptibility to lodging (falling over).

Managing an infestation of Western Corn Rootworm involves an integrated approach. Rotating corn with non-host crops such as soybeans can break the lifecycle of the rootworm, as their larvae cannot survive without corn roots. Another method is the use of Bt corn varieties that are genetically modified to express a protein toxic to the larvae. Soil-applied insecticides can also be effective, but their use should be carefully managed to avoid resistance development. Regular monitoring of adult beetle populations can help in making timely decisions about interventions. Farmers should also consider conservation tillage practices which can disrupt the life cycle of this pest.
