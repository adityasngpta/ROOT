Based on the image provided, the pest appears to be a Grape Colaspis, a common beetle known for its distinctive coloration, typically exhibiting a combination of black and yellow or golden hues. Grape Colaspis primarily affects a variety of crops, including grapes, but it can also impact other plants. 

The leaf depicted in the image shows signs of feeding damage, characterized by notching or irregular edges, which is indicative of the Colaspis feeding on the leaf surface. This feeding can lead to reduced leaf area, negatively affecting the plant's ability to photosynthesize and ultimately impacting growth and yield. Severe infestations can lead to stunted plants and reduced fruit quality due to the stress inflicted on the plant.

To manage a Grape Colaspis infestation, it is crucial to monitor populations during the early growing season. Implementing integrated pest management strategies, such as introducing natural predators like ladybugs and lacewings, can help keep pest numbers in check. Additionally, applying insecticides specifically formulated for beetle control may be effective if infestations exceed threshold levels. Crop rotation and maintaining good soil health can aid in preventing future infestations. Regularly checking for signs of damage and treating early can significantly mitigate impact and promote healthier crop development.
