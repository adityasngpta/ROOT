The image shows a close-up of a corn plant leaf with a distinct, elongated, dark-colored beetle present. This beetle is identified as a **Northern Corn Rootworm**. It's a common pest of corn, and its presence is a clear indication of infestation. The beetle is feeding on the leaf, leaving behind characteristic skeletonized damage. This damage is a result of the beetle consuming the leaf tissue, leaving only the veins and a lacy appearance. The corn plant itself appears healthy overall, with lush green leaves, but the feeding damage from the rootworm beetle can impact the plant's growth and yield, particularly if the infestation is extensive. 

To manage this infestation, the farmer should consider the following steps:

* **Monitoring:** Regularly monitor the corn field for signs of rootworm beetle activity, including the presence of adult beetles, leaf damage, and signs of root damage.
* **Insecticide Application:** If the infestation is severe, the farmer can apply insecticide treatments to control the beetles. There are a variety of insecticides specifically labelled for corn rootworms. Choose a product that is effective against the life stage of the rootworms present.
* **Crop Rotation:** Rotating corn with other crops like soybeans or alfalfa can help disrupt the life cycle of the rootworm and reduce population build-up.
* **Resistant Varieties:** Planting corn varieties that are resistant to rootworms can help reduce the need for insecticides and provide long-term control.
* **Natural Enemies:** Encourage the presence of natural enemies of rootworms in the field, such as beneficial insects like ladybugs and parasitic wasps. 

By implementing these strategies, the farmer can effectively manage the Northern Corn Rootworm infestation and minimize potential damage to the corn crop.
