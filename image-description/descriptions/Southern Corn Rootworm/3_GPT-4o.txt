The pest in the image appears to be a spotted cucumber beetle, also known as Southern Corn Rootworm (Diabrotica undecimpunctata). This pest is easily identifiable by its yellow-green color and distinct black spots on its back. The leaf on which the beetle is seated shows some minor feeding damage, characterized by small, irregular holes and potential discoloration around the edges.

The Southern Corn Rootworm primarily damages crops by feeding on leaves, stems, and roots in their larval stages, which can lead to stunted plant growth and reduced yields. In their adult stage, they continue to damage plants by consuming foliage, although they are less harmful than in their larval stage. The visible damage on the leaf is currently minimal, but if left unchecked, a significant presence of beetles can result in severe defoliation and harm to plant health.

To manage an infestation, it is recommended to monitor crops regularly for early signs of this pest. Applying targeted insecticides can be effective, particularly those designed to combat beetle larvae. Crop rotation can also help minimize the presence of larvae in the soil, reducing future infestations. Additionally, introducing natural predators, such as entomopathogenic nematodes, can provide biological control. Ensuring healthy crop conditions and removing plant debris can further help suppress beetle populations and protect crops from extensive damage.
