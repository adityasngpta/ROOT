Based on the description of the image, it appears that the pest in question could be a Grape Colaspis. This beetle is identifiable by its distinctive yellow and black coloration, which stands out against the green foliage. The plant leaves show signs of stress, with some areas appearing brown and possibly damaged, indicating the pestâ€™s feeding behavior. 

The presence of the Grape Colaspis generally leads to not only cosmetic damage but can also affect the overall health of the plant by impairing photosynthesis and reducing yield potential. The pests often feed on emerging shoots and foliage, which can hinder growth and development.

To manage this infestation, it's advisable to monitor the population closely. For chemical control, insecticides that are effective against beetles can be applied, but it's crucial to follow the label instructions and consider the timing of applications to target the most vulnerable life stages of the pest. Additionally, implementing cultural practices such as crop rotation and maintaining plant health through appropriate fertilization and watering can help to minimize future infestations. Regularly scouting your crops can also help identify pest issues early and take action before they cause significant damage.
