The pest depicted in the image is a Southern Corn Rootworm (Diabrotica undecimpunctata). It is identifiable by its yellowish-green body with distinct black spots on the wings. The plant it is on shows signs of feeding damage along the edges of the leaves, which is typical of the feeding behavior of this beetle.

Southern Corn Rootworms can cause significant damage to crops, especially corn. They primarily feed on the roots of young corn plants, which can lead to stunted growth, poor nutrient uptake, and in severe cases, plant death. Above-ground symptoms often include wilting and lodging, making the plants more susceptible to being blown over by the wind.

To manage an infestation of Southern Corn Rootworm, several strategies can be employed. Crop rotation is effective as the beetles tend to lay eggs in fields where their larvae have abundant food sources. Use of insecticides can also be practical; soil-applied insecticides at planting or foliar applications can help mitigate damage. Additionally, genetically modified corn varieties that express characteristics toxic to rootworms can provide protection. Monitoring and scouting for early signs of beetle presence and implementing timely interventions are crucial for effective management.
