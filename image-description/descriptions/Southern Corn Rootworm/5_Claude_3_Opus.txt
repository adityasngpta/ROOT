Based on the image provided, the pest appears to be a Spotted Cucumber Beetle (Diabrotica undecimpunctata). The beetle has a distinctive yellow body with eleven black spots on its elytra (wing covers), which is a key identifying feature of this species.

The Spotted Cucumber Beetle is seen resting on a green leaf, likely belonging to a cucurbit plant such as cucumber, melon, or squash. The leaf appears healthy and undamaged, suggesting that the infestation may be in its early stages or that the beetle has recently arrived on the plant.

Spotted Cucumber Beetles feed on the leaves, flowers, and fruits of cucurbit plants, causing direct damage through their feeding activities. They can also transmit bacterial wilt disease, which can lead to significant yield losses. As the infestation progresses, the beetles may cause extensive leaf damage, reducing the plant's photosynthetic capacity and overall health.

To manage and control Spotted Cucumber Beetle infestations, farmers can employ a combination of strategies:

1. Monitor plants regularly for the presence of beetles and early signs of damage.
2. Use row covers to physically exclude beetles from the plants, especially during the early growth stages.
3. Apply insecticides, such as carbaryl or permethrin, following label instructions and considering the impact on beneficial insects.
4. Practice crop rotation to reduce the buildup of beetle populations in the soil.
5. Remove and destroy infected plant material to prevent the spread of bacterial wilt disease.

By implementing these management techniques, farmers can minimize the damage caused by Spotted Cucumber Beetles and protect their cucurbit crops from potential yield losses.
