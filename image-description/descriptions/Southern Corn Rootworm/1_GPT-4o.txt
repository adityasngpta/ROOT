The pest in the image is the Southern Corn Rootworm. This beetle can be identified by its yellow-green body with distinctive black spots on its elytra (wing covers). Southern Corn Rootworm is known to cause damage primarily to corn crops by feeding on the roots, which can lead to weakened plants, poor nutrient and water uptake, and ultimately lower yields.

The plant in the background looks relatively healthy, though there are some signs of damage, such as the red streaks on the leaf where the beetle is sitting. These streaks could be indicative of feeding damage or nutrient deficiency exacerbated by rootworm activity.

To manage an infestation of Southern Corn Rootworm, farmers should consider crop rotation to break the pest's lifecycle, as rootworms prefer corn and laying eggs in the same field annually. Using soil insecticides at planting or systemic insecticide seed treatments can also be effective in controlling larval populations. Monitoring fields regularly and applying foliar insecticides when adult populations reach economic thresholds can help manage the adult beetles. Implementing integrated pest management (IPM) strategies, including biological control options and maintaining soil health, can further reduce pest impact and enhance crop resilience.
