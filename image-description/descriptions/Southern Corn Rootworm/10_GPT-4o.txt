The image depicts a Southern Corn Rootworm, identifiable by its yellow-green coloration with black spots. The Southern Corn Rootworm is primarily known for attacking corn crops, but it can also cause damage to other plants, including soybeans. In the image, the pest is seen on a leaf that shows signs of minor damage, such as small holes and slight discoloration. The feeding activity of the Southern Corn Rootworm larvae can cause substantial damage to the roots of corn plants, leading to stunted growth, reduced nutrient uptake, and significant yield loss. Additionally, adult beetles feed on leaves and can damage the silks of corn plants, leading to poor pollination and kernel development.

To manage and control Southern Corn Rootworm infestations, farmers should implement crop rotation with non-host crops to break the life cycle of the pest. Additionally, the use of insecticides, either as a soil treatment at planting or as a foliar spray targeting adult beetles, can help reduce populations. Monitoring pest presence using pheromone traps can provide early warning of infestations, allowing for timely interventions. Implementing integrated pest management practices, such as maintaining diverse crop rotations and using resistant corn hybrids, can also contribute to long-term control and prevention of Southern Corn Rootworm infestations.
