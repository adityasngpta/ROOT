Based on the image provided, the pest appears to be a Spotted Cucumber Beetle (Diabrotica undecimpunctata). The beetle has a distinctive yellow body with eleven black spots on its elytra (wing covers), which is a key identifying feature of this species.

The Spotted Cucumber Beetle is seen resting on a green leaf, likely belonging to a cucurbit plant such as cucumber, melon, or squash. The leaf appears healthy and undamaged, suggesting that the infestation may be in its early stages or that the beetle has recently arrived on the plant.

Spotted Cucumber Beetles feed on the leaves, flowers, and fruits of cucurbit plants, causing damage that can lead to reduced yield and quality. They can also transmit bacterial wilt disease, which can cause significant crop losses. The presence of even a single beetle can indicate a potential infestation that requires prompt management.

To control Spotted Cucumber Beetles, farmers can employ a combination of strategies:

1. Monitor plants regularly for signs of beetle activity and damage.
2. Use row covers to physically exclude beetles from plants during the early growth stages.
3. Apply insecticides, such as carbaryl or permethrin, following label instructions and safety precautions.
4. Practice crop rotation to reduce the buildup of beetle populations in the soil.
5. Remove and destroy infected plant material to prevent the spread of bacterial wilt disease.

Implementing these management techniques can help minimize the impact of Spotted Cucumber Beetles on cucurbit crops and maintain overall plant health and productivity.
