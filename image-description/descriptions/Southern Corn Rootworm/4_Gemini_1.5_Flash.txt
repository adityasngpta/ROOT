The image shows a close-up of a corn plant with a significant infestation of **Northern Corn Rootworm** beetles. The beetles, easily identifiable by their distinctive yellow-brown color and black markings, are concentrated on the leaves of the corn plant.  The leaves themselves exhibit signs of damage, including small holes and ragged edges, indicating the beetles' feeding activity. This feeding damage can stunt the growth of the plant and ultimately reduce the yield of corn ears. The overall health of the plant appears weakened, and the presence of multiple beetles on a single leaf suggests a serious infestation that could lead to significant crop losses if left unchecked.

To effectively manage this infestation, farmers should consider a combination of approaches. **Monitoring** for signs of rootworm activity, such as leaf damage and adult beetle presence, is crucial. **Rotating crops** to break the rootworm's life cycle is a vital preventive measure. This can involve planting soybeans, alfalfa, or other non-host crops in the field for a year or two before returning to corn. **Insecticides** can be applied as a control measure, but careful consideration should be given to the timing and type of insecticide used. Applying insecticides during the larval stage, which typically occurs in the soil, can be highly effective. However, it's important to choose insecticides that are specifically targeted towards rootworms and to follow label instructions carefully to avoid harming beneficial insects or causing environmental damage. Finally, **using resistant corn varieties** that have been genetically modified to resist rootworm damage can also be a valuable strategy for preventing infestations.
