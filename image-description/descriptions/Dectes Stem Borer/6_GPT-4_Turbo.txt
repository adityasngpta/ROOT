The insect in the image is a Dectes Stem Borer, identifiable by its elongated, cylindrical body and relatively long antennae, which are typical characteristics of this pest. The Dectes Stem Borer is shown located on a corn leaf, which is a common host for this pest.

The health of the crop, as observed in the image, appears to be in fair condition; however, the presence of the Dectes Stem Borer poses a significant risk to the plant's health as these borers typically tunnel into the stems of their host plants, which can lead to plant lodging (falling over) and can disrupt nutrient and water flow through plant tissues. This type of damage is especially detrimental close to harvest, as it can significantly reduce yield.

For managing a Dectes Stem Borer infestation, it's vital to consider integrated pest management strategies. Crop rotation and timely harvesting are crucial, as these practices can help minimize the available habitat and breeding grounds for these pests. Removing and destroying infested residues immediately after harvest can also prevent the pests from overwintering in the debris, thereby breaking their lifecycle. Chemical controls can be used, but they are generally less effective once the larvae have bored into the stems. Therefore, preventive measures and early detection are key in managing Dectes Stem Borer populations. Monitoring and scouting for the adults during early to mid-summer can help in making informed decisions about the necessity for control measures.
