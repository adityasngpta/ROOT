The image shows a close-up of a corn plant, revealing significant damage caused by **Northern Corn Rootworm** larvae. The plant's leaves are wilted and discolored, indicating a lack of nutrients and water, which are likely due to the rootworm's feeding on the roots. The presence of small holes in the leaves suggests that the larvae have also been feeding on the foliage. The roots of the corn plant are likely heavily damaged, further contributing to the plant's weakened state. This infestation presents a serious threat to the yield and health of the corn crop, as the larvae can severely damage the roots, impeding the plant's ability to absorb nutrients and water. 

To manage this infestation, a combination of preventative and reactive measures is recommended.  Firstly, crop rotation can help to disrupt the rootworm's life cycle. Planting non-corn crops, such as soybeans, for at least one year can reduce rootworm populations. Secondly, insecticide applications can be used to control the larvae during the growing season.  Applying a granular insecticide to the soil at planting time can protect the roots from larval feeding. Lastly, planting resistant corn hybrids can provide a long-term solution. These hybrids are genetically modified to resist rootworm damage, reducing the need for chemical treatments. By employing these strategies, farmers can effectively manage Northern Corn Rootworm infestations and protect their corn crops from significant yield losses.
