The insect shown in the image is a Dectes Stem Borer, identifiable by its elongated, cylindrical body and solid gray or black color. This beetle is known for its preference for soybean plants among others, where it particularly targets the stems.

Looking at the background plant, it is in relatively good condition at this moment, but the presence of Dectes Stem Borer can lead to significant issues if not managed. This pest typically burrows into the stems, which can weaken and even break the plants, leading to yield loss especially when infestation levels are high. 

To manage this pest, it is crucial to implement an integrated pest management (IPM) strategy. Crop rotation can be effective, as it disrupts the life cycle of the beetle. Regular scouting and monitoring of plants for signs of damage and beetle activity should be carried out to assess the need for control measures. If chemical control is necessary, it should be timed to target the larvae before they bore into the stems. Use pesticides that are effective against borers and apply them as directed to maximize efficacy and minimize environmental impact.
