The image depicts a Dectes Stem Borer, an insect noticeable by its distinctive long antennae and narrow body. The pest is positioned on the underside of a leaf. The leaf shows obvious signs of feeding damage, evidenced by the irregular hole. The presence of Dectes Stem Borer can lead to significant crop damage as the larvae bore into the stems of plants, weakening them and making them susceptible to breakage. This can ultimately result in reduced yields and poor plant health.

Management of Dectes Stem Borer includes rotating crops to prevent the buildup of the pest in the soil, harvesting crops early to limit the period larvae can bore into stems, and maintaining good crop residue management by shredding or plowing under stubble to destroy overwintering larvae. Chemical treatments might not always be effective since larvae are protected within the plant stems. However, applications of systemic insecticides can sometimes provide control when timed correctly, often targeting adults before they lay eggs. It is also beneficial to monitor fields to catch infestations early and take timely action.
