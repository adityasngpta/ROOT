The insect in the image you've provided is a Dectes Stem Borer. You can tell by its elongated, cylindrical body, grayish blue color, and long antennae that are typical characteristics of this pest. The Dectes Stem Borer primarily targets soybeans and other leguminous crops but can also be found on other plants.

In the image, the insect is seen on a soybean leaf, which appears to be in relatively good condition apart from a few holes indicating initial feeding damage. This type of damage is typically not severe in early stages but can lead to more significant issues if the pest population increases or the borers begin to infest the stems.

Dectes Stem Borers lay their eggs in the stems of plants, and the larvae feed within, potentially girdling the stem and causing plants to lodge or break, particularly near harvest time. This not only affects yield directly by damaging the plant structure but can also facilitate the entry of disease organisms through the damaged tissue.

To manage a Dectes Stem Borer infestation, consider the following strategies:
1. Crop rotation: Rotate out of soybeans or other susceptible crops to break the life cycle of the borers.
2. Timely harvest: Harvesting as soon as the crop reaches maturity can help reduce damage since the borers are still inside the stems.
3. Destruction of crop residues: Since borers can overwinter in the stems of old plants, destroying residues can help reduce the population.
