The image shows a close-up of a corn plant with a **Northern Corn Rootworm** larva present. The larva is white with a brown head and is burrowed into the stalk of the corn plant. The corn plant itself appears to be healthy, with vibrant green leaves and a robust stalk, but the presence of the larva could indicate potential damage and yield loss. Northern Corn Rootworm larvae feed on the roots of corn plants, causing damage that weakens the plant and hinders its ability to absorb nutrients and water. This can lead to stunted growth, wilting, and even plant death. The damage caused by the larva is not yet visible in the image, but it is likely that the plant's health will deteriorate over time if the infestation is not managed. 

To control the infestation, you should consider using an insecticide that targets Northern Corn Rootworm larvae, such as a soil-applied insecticide or an insecticide that is applied as a foliar spray. Preventive measures include using corn rootworm-resistant corn hybrids, practicing crop rotation to break the pest's life cycle, and using tillage practices to disrupt the larvae's habitat. It's important to monitor the plant closely for signs of further damage and take action accordingly to minimize the impact on your yield.
