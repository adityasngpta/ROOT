The insect in your image is the Dectes Stem Borer, easily identifiable by its robust, cylindrical body, smooth gray to light blue exoskeleton, and long black antennae that are often longer than its body. This pest typically targets soybean and sunflower crops but can also infest other types of plants.

From your image, it appears the Dectes Stem Borer has been infesting the plant it is located on, which can lead to significant issues. Infestation signs often include wilting of plants due to the larva tunneling through the stem, which disrupts the plant's ability to transport water and nutrients. Over time, this can cause stem breakage, particularly during strong winds or heavy rain, leading to direct yield loss.

To manage a Dectes Stem Borer infestation, it is crucial to consider crop rotation, as the larvae overwinter inside the stems of old plants. Removing and destroying infested crop residue post-harvest can help reduce the population. Additionally, delayed planting can allow the larvae to emerge from the overwintered stems before the new crop is planted, thus lacking host plants to infest. Chemical control options are limited and often not effective due to the nature of the larva living inside the stem, but if the infestation is localized, spot treatments with approved insecticides might be helpful.

Monitoring the crop regularly and employing an integrated pest management strategy, including mechanical, cultural, and, if necessary, chemical controls, are recommended
