The insect depicted in the image is the Dectes Stem Borer. This pest is known to cause significant damage to crops, particularly soybeans and sunflowers. The Dectes Stem Borer typically lays its eggs in the stems of these plants, where the larvae then burrow and feed internally. This feeding can cause the stems to weaken and eventually break, leading to lodging and reduced plant vigor, which in turn affects the overall yield.

The surrounding leaf in the image shows some notching at the edges, which is indicative of the pest's feeding activity. The plant appears otherwise healthy, but the presence of the Dectes Stem Borer poses a serious risk to the structural integrity of the plant.

To manage Dectes Stem Borer infestations, it is crucial to monitor fields regularly for signs of adult beetles and stem damage during the growing season. Crop rotation can be an effective preventive measure, as can planting less susceptible crops in infested fields. Additionally, timely harvesting can help minimize damage, as larvae tend to cause the most harm late in the growing season. Insecticide treatments are not typically recommended once larvae are inside the stems, but early-season applications targeting adult beetles may help reduce egg laying. Integrating these strategies can help in managing and controlling the impact of Dectes Stem Borer on crops.
