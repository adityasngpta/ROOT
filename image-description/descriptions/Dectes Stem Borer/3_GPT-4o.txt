The pest in the image appears to be a Dectes Stem Borer. This insect is known to cause significant damage to crops such as soybeans by boring into the stems. The visible plant in the photograph seems to be healthy overall, maintaining a green color with minimal visible damage to the leaves at this stage.

However, the impact of the Dectes Stem Borer may not be immediately apparent on the plant surface. The larvae bore into the stems, compromising the plant's structural integrity, which can lead to lodging (where plants fall over), disrupting the plant’s nutrient and water transport systems and overall leading to significant yield loss. Symptoms of an infestation often present later in the growing season or closer to harvest when the weakened stems may break.

To manage or control an infestation of Dectes Stem Borers, it is crucial to implement an integrated pest management strategy. This includes regular monitoring of fields for early signs of infestation, particularly paying close attention to plants for any boring activity. Crop rotation is effective; planting non-host crops like corn can help break the pest’s life cycle. Raising the cutter bar height during harvest can leave the lower portion of the stalk, where larvae overwinter. Additionally, timely harvest can reduce the risk of lodging. Chemical controls are usually less effective because the larvae reside inside the stems, which protects them from pesticides. However, ensuring general plant health through proper fertilization and irrigation can also help fortify the plants against pest damage.
