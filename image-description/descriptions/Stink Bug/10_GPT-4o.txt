This image displays a Stink Bug, a common agricultural pest known for affecting a variety of crops by feeding on the plant juices beneath the surface of leaves, stems, and fruits. This puncturing causes damage which can lead to deformities in fruits and vegetables, such as tomatoes, beans, and corn. Beneath the bug's feeding spots, tissue damage can manifest as necrotic spots, reducing the plant's photosynthetic ability and overall health. Severe infestations can lead to significant yield loss.

The plant in the background appears to be generally healthy; however, the presence of the stink bug suggests a potential threat. If left unchecked, stink bugs can proliferate rapidly, leading to more severe infestations.

To manage stink bug infestations, it is crucial to monitor crop fields regularly. Hand-picking and removing the bugs from the plants can be a practical solution for smaller infestations. For larger crops, utilization of pheromone traps can help in monitoring and controlling their population. Insecticides such as pyrethroids can be effective; however, the timing of application is critical, and care should be taken to avoid harming beneficial insects. Implementing crop rotation and destroying crop residues can also minimize overwintering sites for stink bugs, reducing their numbers in the next growing season.
