The image shows a Stink Bug, which can significantly impact fruit crops, particularly apples. Stink Bugs feed on plant sap using their piercing mouthparts, leading to visible damage on the fruit. In this case, the apple appears to show signs of tissue distortion or scarring where the bug has been feeding, which can result in reduced marketability and potential yield loss. The presence of multiple Stink Bugs suggests a more serious infestation, indicating that prompt action may be necessary to manage their population.

To control Stink Bug infestations, consider using insecticidal sprays or traps specifically designed for Stink Bugs. It's also essential to monitor the crop regularly and take action at the first signs of the pest. Encouraging natural predators, such as certain birds or beneficial insects, can help manage the population organically. Additionally, implementing crop rotation and maintaining a clean orchard floor can reduce the likelihood of future infestations. Taking these steps can help protect your apple crop from further damage and improve overall yield quality.
