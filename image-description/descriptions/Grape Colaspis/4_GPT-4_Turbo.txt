The image shows a Southern Corn Rootworm (Diabrotica undecimpunctata), an adult beetle identifiable by its relatively small size, rounded body, and distinctive light brown or tan color with fine parallel lines running down its wings. This pest is predominantly found on the foliage of various crops but is notably a serious pest in corn.

The visible portion of the leaf in the photograph indicates almost direct evidence of slight feeding damage, likely caused by this pest. Such feeding typically results in small, irregular holes in the leaves, which can reduce the photosynthetic area of the plant and potentially lead to a decrease in overall plant health and productivity if the infestation is severe.

Management of Southern Corn Rootworm primarily involves cultural practices such as crop rotation, as the pest often struggles to survive when their preferred host crop is not available. Additionally, planting transgenic corn varieties that express Bt (Bacillus thuringiensis) proteins can effectively control rootworm larvae, reducing the need for chemical insecticides. However, if damage and pest population levels exceed economic thresholds, the use of registered insecticides may be necessary. It's essential to monitor the pest's population actively and apply treatments timed correctly to target larvae and adult stages effectively. For organic management, practices such as timely tillage to destroy larvae and the use of natural predators and biocontrol agents can also form part of an integrated pest management strategy.
