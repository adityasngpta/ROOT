Based on the description of the pest in the image, it appears to be a Grape Colaspis. This small, golden-brown beetle can often be found on the leaves of various plants. The visible damage associated with the Grape Colaspis includes notching or irregular holes in leaves, which can lead to reduced photosynthesis and overall plant stress. If present in significant numbers, these pests can weaken plants, potentially affecting their growth and resulting in lower yields.

To manage an infestation of Grape Colaspis, consider implementing cultural controls such as crop rotation and maintaining healthy soil to promote robust plant growth. Monitoring for the presence of adult beetles and larvae is essential. If the population reaches a damaging level, insecticides specifically labeled for Grape Colaspis should be applied, focusing on treating the foliage where the beetles are active. Timing is important; applications should ideally occur when the pests are young to maximize effectiveness. Additionally, encouraging natural predators and beneficial insects can help keep Grape Colaspis populations in check. Regularly scouting your crops will aid in early detection and minimize damage.
