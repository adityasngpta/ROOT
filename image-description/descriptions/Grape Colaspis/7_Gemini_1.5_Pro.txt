The image depicts a lush, green soybean field in good health overall. However, the presence of defoliation is evident on some leaves, with irregular holes and chewed edges indicating feeding activity. Based on the feeding pattern and the visible insects, the pests impacting this soybean field are likely **grasshoppers**. These insects are known to feed on foliage, and their presence, coupled with the observed damage, strongly suggests an active infestation. To manage this grasshopper infestation, the farmer could consider applying registered insecticides targeting grasshoppers. Additionally, closely monitoring the field for further increases in grasshopper populations is crucial. Implementing preventative measures such as tilling the field after harvest can disrupt grasshopper egg-laying sites and help reduce the risk of future infestations.
