The image shows a Grape Colaspis beetle (Colaspis brunnea) on a soybean leaf. This small, oval-shaped beetle has a distinctive light brown or tan coloration with longitudinal ridges on its wing covers. The Grape Colaspis is sitting on a green soybean leaf, which appears to be in relatively good health, with only minor visible damage at this stage.

Grape Colaspis beetles can be significant pests in soybean fields, as well as in corn and other crops. While adult beetles feed on foliage, causing shot-hole feeding damage, the larvae are often more problematic as they feed on plant roots, potentially leading to stunted growth and yield loss. The presence of this beetle suggests that there may be a population in the field that requires monitoring and potentially management.

To address this pest issue, farmers should first assess the extent of the infestation by scouting their fields regularly. If Grape Colaspis populations reach economic thresholds, management strategies may include the use of insecticides. Seed treatments containing neonicotinoids can be effective against the larvae, while foliar insecticides may be necessary to control adult populations if defoliation becomes severe. Cultural practices such as crop rotation, particularly with non-host crops like small grains, can help break the pest cycle. Additionally, maintaining good soil health and plant vigor can help crops withstand some level of Grape Colaspis feeding. It's important to consult with local agricultural extension services for specific economic thresholds and treatment recommendations tailored to your region and crop stage, as management decisions should be based on pest population levels, crop growth stage, and potential economic impact.
