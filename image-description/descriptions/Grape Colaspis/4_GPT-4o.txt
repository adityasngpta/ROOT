The pest depicted in the image is a Northern Corn Rootworm. This beetle is known to have a significant impact on corn crops. The primary damage inflicted by Northern Corn Rootworm comes from the larvae, which feed on the corn roots, leading to root pruning, lodging, and reduced nutrient uptake. This root damage can cause the corn plants to become unstable and fall over, severely impacting yield. 

Adult beetles also contribute to crop damage by feeding on corn silks, which can interfere with pollination and result in poor kernel development. To manage Northern Corn Rootworm infestations, crop rotation is an effective preventive measure since the larvae need corn roots to survive. In fields with a history of Northern Corn Rootworm problems, consider using Bt-corn hybrids specifically engineered to resist rootworm feeding. Additionally, soil insecticides or seed treatments containing neonicotinoids can be applied to combat larvae. Monitoring the pest population with traps and employing threshold-based insecticide applications are also critical strategies for managing this pest. Regular field scouting and timely interventions are essential to protect corn yield from the detrimental effects of Northern Corn Rootworm.
