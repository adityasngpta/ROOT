The image shows a close-up of a corn plant with a significant infestation of **Western Corn Rootworm** larvae. The larvae are clearly visible, burrowing into the corn stalk near the soil line. The corn plant itself appears to be wilting and stressed, with leaves turning yellow and drooping. The presence of these rootworm larvae is causing significant damage to the plant's root system, hindering its ability to absorb water and nutrients. This will likely lead to stunted growth, reduced yield, and even plant death if left unmanaged. 

To combat this infestation, farmers should consider using a combination of methods. **Preventive measures** include rotating crops to break the rootworm's life cycle, planting resistant corn varieties, and using biological control agents like entomopathogenic nematodes. **Chemical control** options include applying insecticide soil treatments at planting or using foliar insecticides to target adults. However, it's crucial to carefully consider the potential environmental impact of chemical treatments and to follow all label instructions. Regular monitoring for signs of infestation and early intervention are key to effectively managing Western Corn Rootworm and preserving crop yield.
