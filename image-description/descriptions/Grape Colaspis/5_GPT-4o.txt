The pest depicted in the image is a Western Corn Rootworm (Diabrotica virgifera virgifera). It is identifiable by its yellow to light brown color and distinctive striped pattern on its wing covers. The Western Corn Rootworm is a significant pest in cornfields, as both the larvae and adult beetles cause damage to the crop. 

The larvae feed on corn roots, which can lead to reduced nutrient and water uptake by the plants, making them more susceptible to lodging (falling over). Adult beetles feed on corn silks, which can interfere with pollination and kernel development, leading to yield losses. Additionally, adult beetles may also chew on leaves, creating a tattered appearance and further stressing the plants.

To manage an infestation of Western Corn Rootworm, crop rotation is one of the most effective strategies, as the larvae rely on corn roots for development. Using pest-resistant corn varieties and applying soil insecticides at planting can help control larval populations. For adult beetles, foliar insecticides can be used if populations exceed economic thresholds. Regular scouting of cornfields for adult beetles and monitoring for root injury can help in timely decision-making for pest control measures. Implementing an integrated pest management (IPM) approach is also crucial to sustainably manage this pest.
