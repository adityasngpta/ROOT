The image depicts a corn plant with clear signs of infestation by the Western Corn Rootworm. Several adult beetles are visible on the leaves, their characteristic metallic-green coloration and elongated bodies easily recognizable. The plant exhibits significant damage, particularly on the leaves, which are riddled with holes and exhibit signs of defoliation. This damage is consistent with the feeding habits of Western Corn Rootworms, which primarily target corn leaves, often causing substantial damage to the plant's foliage.  The presence of these beetles, alongside the evident leaf damage, indicates a potentially serious infestation, likely impacting the plant's ability to photosynthesize effectively, potentially leading to stunted growth and reduced yield.  

To manage this infestation, it is crucial to act promptly. Insecticides specifically targeting Western Corn Rootworms can be applied to control the beetles and prevent further damage. Additionally, implementing preventative measures such as crop rotation with non-corn crops can disrupt the life cycle of the rootworms, hindering their ability to establish populations. Monitoring the field regularly for signs of infestation and implementing early intervention strategies are crucial to minimizing the impact of Western Corn Rootworm on yield and ensuring a healthy corn crop.
