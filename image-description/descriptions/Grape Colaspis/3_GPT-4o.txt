The insect in the image is a Northern Corn Rootworm, a pest known for attacking corn crops. It has a light brown or yellowish color and a cylindrical body typical of rootworms. The background shows a healthy leaf, but the presence of this pest is concerning. Northern Corn Rootworms primarily target corn roots, causing significant damage by feeding on them, which can lead to stunted plant growth, lodging (where plants fall over), and ultimately reduced yield. 

To manage and control this pest infestation, it is recommended to rotate crops regularly as continuous corn planting encourages rootworm populations. Using insecticide treatments specific to rootworms during the planting season can also be effective. Additionally, incorporating genetically modified corn varieties that express rootworm resistance can help protect the crops. Implementing these strategies can reduce the impact on crop health and yield, ensuring better growth and productivity.
