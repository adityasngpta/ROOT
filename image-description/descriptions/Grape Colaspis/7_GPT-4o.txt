The pest in the image is a Southern Corn Rootworm, identifiable by its yellowish-green color with distinct longitudinal stripes on its back. This beetle is perched on a leaf that appears to be slightly damaged, indicated by the irregular feeding marks along the edges. The presence of the Southern Corn Rootworm can significantly impact the health of crops, especially corn, by feeding on the roots during their larval stage, which leads to stunted growth and potential yield loss. Aboveground, adult beetles can cause damage to the leaves and silks of corn plants, which can hinder pollination and kernel development.

To manage and control an infestation of Southern Corn Rootworms, crop rotation is an effective preventive measure, as it disrupts their life cycle. Using insecticides, such as soil-applied systemic insecticides at planting time or foliar sprays during the adult beetle stage, can help reduce their populations. Additionally, employing integrated pest management (IPM) practices, such as monitoring pest levels with traps and employing biological controls like entomopathogenic nematodes, can further aid in mitigating their impact on crops. Regular field scouting and timely application of recommended treatments are crucial for keeping Southern Corn Rootworm populations in check and minimizing damage to the crops.
