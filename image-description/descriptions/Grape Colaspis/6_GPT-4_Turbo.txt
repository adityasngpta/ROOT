The pest in the image is identified as the Southern Corn Rootworm, also known as the spotted cucumber beetle. This beetle is characterized by its distinct yellowish to tan color with darker stripes running longitudinally along its elytra (wing covers). The beetle is shown on a leaf, which appears to be in good health apart from the presence of the pest.

Southern Corn Rootworms can cause significant damage to a variety of crops, including corn, cucumbers, and other vegetables. They primarily damage plants by feeding on their roots as larvae, and leaves and flowers as adults, which can result in reduced yield and plant health. In the case of corn, these beetles can also transmit bacterial wilt and cucumber mosaic virus, which can further degrade crop health and productivity.

To manage an infestation of Southern Corn Rootworms, an integrated pest management approach is recommended. This could include the use of crop rotation to disrupt the life cycle of the rootworm, planting resistant crop varieties if available, and using appropriate insecticides. Biological control measures such as encouraging natural predators, like ladybugs, can also be effective. Regular monitoring of the crop for signs of damage and the presence of these beetles is crucial to prevent severe infestations.
