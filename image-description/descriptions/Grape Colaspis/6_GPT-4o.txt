The image shows a Japanese beetle. This pest is characterized by its distinctive metallic green body and copper-colored wings. The beetle is found on green foliage, indicating that it is actively feeding. Evidence of feeding damage is visible on the leaves, including holes and torn leaf margins. Such damage can reduce photosynthesis, weaken the plant, and ultimately diminish crop yield if the infestation is severe.

To manage and control a Japanese beetle infestation, it is recommended to use insecticides such as pyrethroids or carbamates, which are effective against these beetles. Additionally, adult beetles can be manually removed in smaller gardens to reduce population density. Implementing crop rotation and planting trap crops like geraniums can also help manage these pests. Finally, beneficial nematodes or milky spore disease can be used to target the larval stage in the soil, reducing future adult beetle emergence. Regular monitoring and early intervention are crucial to managing Japanese beetle populations effectively.
