The insect in the image is a Japanese beetle. It is recognizable by its brown, shiny body and the distinctive segmented appearance of its back. The beetle is perched on the leaf of a plant, which appears to be relatively healthy besides minor feeding damage visible as small, irregular spaces along the leaf edges where the beetle has been feeding. 

Japanese beetles are known to feed on a wide variety of plants, and they can cause significant damage to both the foliage and the flowers of the plants they infest. The damage from Japanese beetles can reduce photosynthesis, weaken plants, and potentially decrease yields in crop plants.

To manage and control Japanese beetle infestations, it is important to take a multi-faceted approach. Physical removal of the beetles can be done by hand if the infestation is light. For more severe infestations, application of pesticides specifically labeled for use against Japanese beetles can be effective. It is also beneficial to treat the soil with products that target the larval stage of the beetle to prevent future generations from emerging. Integrating a strategy that includes monitoring, physical controls, and chemical treatments will help manage the populations effectively and protect plant health.
