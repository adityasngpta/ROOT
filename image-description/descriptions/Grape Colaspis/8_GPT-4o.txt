The insect depicted in the image is a Grape Colaspis. Grape Colaspis can be identified by their small, oval-shaped bodies that are generally golden-brown in color. Adult beetles have fine lines running down their backs, as seen in the image. This pest is known to feed on a variety of crops, including corn and soybeans.

The leaf in the background appears to be of relatively healthy condition with no significant signs of pest damage immediately surrounding the beetle. However, Grape Colaspis larvae can cause notable damage to the root systems of plants, leading to symptoms such as stunted growth, yellowing leaves, and reduced plant vigor. 

For managing and controlling Grape Colaspis, consider using crop rotation to break the life cycle of the pest. Apply insecticide treatments targeted at the larvae stage if you notice significant root damage or signs of infestation. Additionally, maintaining healthy soil and controlling weed populations can reduce the likelihood of infestations. Regular monitoring of crops for early signs of pest presence is crucial to manage this pest effectively.
