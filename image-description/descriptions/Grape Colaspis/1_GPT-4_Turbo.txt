The insect visible in the image is a Southern Corn Rootworm, also known scientifically as Diabrotica undecimpunctata howardi. This pest is easily recognizable by its oval-shaped body, light tan to yellowish color, and the black stripes that run longitudinally down its wing covers.

In the image, the Southern Corn Rootworm is perched on a leaf, most likely from a plant within the vicinity where it typically feeds. The leaf appears to be in good condition, with no observable stress or significant feeding damage nearby. However, the presence of a Southern Corn Rootworm can be of concern, as their larvae are known to feed on plant roots, which can significantly impact the health of the plant by reducing nutrient uptake and overall growth vigour.

To manage and control this pest, it is recommended to monitor fields regularly to catch infestations early. Crop rotation with non-host crops and planting resistant varieties if available can help reduce the severity of damage. Biological control agents such as nematodes have been used successfully against larvae in the soil. Chemical control may be warranted if there are large populations of adults, especially during critical growth stages of the crop. Insecticide treatments should be carefully selected and timed to maximize efficacy while minimizing non-target effects. As always, consulting with a local agricultural extension service or an integrated pest management professional is advised to address specific conditions and comply with local regulations.
