The best time to scout for Western Corn Rootworms in your fields is from late June through July. This period is crucial because it aligns with the emergence of adult rootworms. Begin scouting your cornfields weekly starting when the corn begins to silk, as this is when adult rootworms are typically most active and visible. Pay special attention to the presence of beetles and signs of silk clipping. Early detection during this peak activity period is key to managing and mitigating the damage caused by these pests effectively.
