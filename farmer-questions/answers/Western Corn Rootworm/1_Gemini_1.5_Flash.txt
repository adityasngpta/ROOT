Early detection of Western Corn Rootworm (WCR) infestation is crucial for effective management. Look for these telltale signs in your corn fields:

**1. Wilting and Stunted Growth:**  WCR larvae feed on corn roots, disrupting nutrient and water uptake. This can cause wilting, especially during hot or dry weather, and stunted growth compared to healthy plants.

**2. Root Damage:**  Inspect the roots of affected plants. You'll find characteristic "shredded" or "ragged" root damage, often with numerous feeding tunnels. These tunnels can be visible even after the larvae have matured.

**3. Leaf Discoloration:**  WCR damage to the roots can lead to nutrient deficiencies, which may manifest as yellowing or browning of the leaves, particularly in the lower parts of the plant.

**4. Lodging:**  As root damage progresses, the plants become weaker and more prone to lodging (falling over) due to wind or heavy rainfall.

**5. Premature Death:**  In severe infestations, the root damage can become so extensive that the plants may die prematurely, leading to significant yield losses.

**6. "Dead Heart" Syndrome:**  While less common, WCR can also attack the stalks above ground, causing "dead heart" syndrome. This results in the plant's growing point dying, resulting in a stunted, deformed ear.

By monitoring for these early signs, you can implement control measures proactively, preventing significant yield losses and ensuring a healthy corn crop.
