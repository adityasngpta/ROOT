Crop rotation is a powerful tool for managing Western Corn Rootworm (WCR) populations.  Because this pest overwinters in the soil and its larvae primarily feed on corn roots, planting a different crop after corn disrupts its lifecycle. When WCR adults emerge in fields without corn, they struggle to find food and lay eggs, leading to a significant decline in their population. The effectiveness of crop rotation is further enhanced by choosing non-host crops like soybeans or small grains that won't support the WCR lifecycle. Continuous corn planting, on the other hand, creates an ideal environment for WCR to thrive, leading to damaging infestations and yield loss.  Therefore, rotating corn with other crops is a crucial component of sustainable WCR management, reducing reliance on insecticides and promoting a healthier soil ecosystem.
