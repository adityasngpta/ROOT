Bt corn hybrids are highly effective against Western Corn Rootworms, offering a significant level of protection by producing specific proteins that are toxic to these pests. These proteins, derived from Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt), target the larvae of the rootworms, reducing their survival and subsequent damage to the corn roots. This genetic modification allows the corn to defend itself against attacks, leading to better crop health and yield. However, it's important to note that resistance management is crucial. Continuous use of Bt corn can lead to resistance in rootworm populations. Therefore, integrating other management strategies, such as crop rotation and the use of refuges (planting non-Bt corn nearby), is recommended to sustain the effectiveness of Bt corn and manage resistance in Western Corn Rootworm populations.
