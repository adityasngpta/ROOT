Economic thresholds for Western Corn Rootworm (WCR) control typically depend on the crop stage and the specific monitoring method used. For adult beetle counts, a common threshold is 0.5 to 1 beetle per plant, or 35-50% of plants with silk feeding. However, for larval damage, thresholds are often based on root ratings, with treatment recommended when ratings exceed 0.25 on a 0-3 scale (where 3 represents severe root pruning). It's important to note that these thresholds can vary depending on factors such as corn prices, control costs, and expected yield. Some experts also suggest using sticky traps, with a threshold of 2-4 beetles per trap per day. Regular scouting and monitoring are crucial for accurate decision-making. Additionally, consider rotating crops, using Bt corn hybrids, or applying soil insecticides at planting as preventative measures if WCR has been a persistent problem in your fields. Always consult with your local extension service for region-specific recommendations, as thresholds may vary based on local conditions and resistance patterns.
