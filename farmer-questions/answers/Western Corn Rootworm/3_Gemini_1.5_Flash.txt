The best time to scout for Western Corn Rootworms (WCR) in your fields is during the V4-V6 growth stage of your corn crop, which typically occurs in June. This is when the adult beetles are most active and laying eggs in the soil.  You should focus your scouting efforts on fields with a history of WCR infestations or those in high-risk areas. Look for the characteristic "D" shaped exit holes on corn stalks, evidence of root damage, and the presence of adult beetles. You should also check for the presence of eggs by digging a small hole in the soil near the base of the corn plant.  The eggs are small and white and can be found in clusters. If you find evidence of WCR infestation, you can use a variety of control methods, including insecticide applications, resistant hybrids, and crop rotation.  Regular scouting and prompt action are key to effective WCR management and protecting your corn yield.
