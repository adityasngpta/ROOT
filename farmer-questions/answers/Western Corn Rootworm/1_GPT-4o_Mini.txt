Early signs of Western Corn Rootworm infestation in corn fields include the presence of small, irregularly shaped holes in the leaves, particularly on the lower leaves, which can indicate feeding damage. Additionally, you may notice yellowing or wilting of plants, especially during dry conditions, as the root damage affects the plant's ability to uptake water and nutrients. Another critical sign is the presence of larvae in the soil, which can be identified by digging around the root zone and looking for small, white, C-shaped larvae. If you observe these symptoms, it is essential to monitor the situation closely and consider implementing integrated pest management strategies, such as crop rotation, using resistant hybrids, or applying targeted insecticides, to mitigate the infestation and protect your corn crop.
