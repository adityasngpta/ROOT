Bt corn hybrids can be highly effective against Western Corn Rootworms (WCR) when used as part of an integrated pest management strategy. These genetically modified crops produce Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) proteins that are toxic to specific insect pests, including WCR larvae, thereby reducing root damage and improving plant health and yield. However, the effectiveness can diminish over time if WCR populations develop resistance to the Bt proteins. To mitigate this risk, it is crucial to implement resistance management practices such as crop rotation, using pyramided Bt hybrids (which express multiple Bt proteins), and integrating other control methods like soil insecticides or biological controls. Regular monitoring of WCR populations and adherence to refuge requirements are also essential to sustain the long-term efficacy of Bt corn hybrids.
