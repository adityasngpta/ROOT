To differentiate Western Corn Rootworm (WCR) damage from other pests, there are a few key signs to look for. First, examine the corn plant's root system. WCR larvae feed on the roots, causing them to appear pruned or stubby, with a "goose-necked" appearance as the plant tries to compensate. You may also see root lodging or the plant leaning to one side due to the weakened root structure. Additionally, look for the presence of WCR larvae themselves - they are white, C-shaped grubs with dark brown heads. Another indicator is the timing of the damage - WCR larvae typically feed on roots in mid-to-late summer. In contrast, other common corn pests like cutworms or wireworms may cause similar root damage but at different times of the growing season. Carefully inspecting the roots and monitoring the timing of the issue can help you accurately diagnose WCR infestation versus other pest problems affecting your corn crop.
