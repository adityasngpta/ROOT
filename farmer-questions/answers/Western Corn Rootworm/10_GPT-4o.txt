Weather conditions significantly influence the activity and damage caused by Western Corn Rootworm (WCR). Warm temperatures, particularly during the growing season, can accelerate the development and lifecycle of WCR, leading to higher populations and increased damage to corn roots. Mild winters can also enhance WCR survival rates, resulting in more severe infestations in the following growing season. Conversely, extremely hot and dry conditions can reduce WCR activity as the larvae and adults may struggle to survive in such harsh environments. Additionally, heavy rainfall can drown larvae in the soil, reducing their numbers. However, wet conditions can also promote lush corn growth, which may attract more adult beetles. Understanding these weather patterns can help farmers anticipate WCR activity and implement timely management practices, such as crop rotation, soil insecticides, or genetically modified corn varieties that are resistant to WCR.
