Weather conditions significantly influence Western Corn Rootworm activity and the potential for damage to crops. Warm temperatures and dry conditions during egg-laying (typically July and August) favor higher egg survival rates, leading to larger populations the following year. Conversely, excessive rainfall during egg-laying can drown eggs and reduce their viability.  Moist soil conditions in the spring encourage egg hatching and larval survival, while hot, dry weather in the spring can dehydrate and kill vulnerable larvae.  Understanding the correlation between weather patterns and the Western Corn Rootworm lifecycle empowers farmers to anticipate pest pressure, implement timely preventative measures, and make informed decisions about insecticide applications, ultimately optimizing crop protection strategies.
