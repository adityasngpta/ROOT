Early signs of Western Corn Rootworm (WCR) infestation in corn fields include leaf feeding by adult beetles, which results in characteristic parallel slits or scrapes on the leaf surface. However, this leaf damage is not usually economically significant. More importantly, farmers should be on the lookout for signs of larval feeding on the roots, which can lead to significant yield losses. Symptoms of larval root damage include stunted plant growth, nutrient deficiencies, and reduced drought tolerance due to the compromised root system. Severely affected plants may exhibit lodging (falling over) or "goosenecking," where the plant grows sideways before turning upwards. Farmers should monitor for adult beetles during silking and conduct root digs to assess larval damage. If the average root damage rating exceeds 0.25 on a 0-3 scale, economic losses are likely, and management strategies such as crop rotation or use of Bt corn hybrids should be considered for the following growing season.
