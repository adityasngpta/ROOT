Western Corn Rootworm damage is characterized by distinctive feeding patterns on corn roots. The larvae initially feed on root hairs and outer root tissues, progressing to tunneling and burrowing into the roots as they mature. This feeding causes significant root pruning, leading to stunted growth, reduced nutrient and water uptake, and lodging, particularly in late summer or early fall when winds easily topple the plants. The most telling sign is the presence of  "goosenecking" where the weakened base of the plant causes it to bend horizontally near the ground.  While other pests like wireworms and white grubs can also damage corn roots, their feeding patterns differ. Wireworms create small, round holes or scars on the roots, while white grubs typically cause more extensive chewing and gouging of the roots.  Accurately identifying Western Corn Rootworm damage is crucial for implementing effective management strategies, including crop rotation, insecticide treatments, and the use of resistant corn varieties.
