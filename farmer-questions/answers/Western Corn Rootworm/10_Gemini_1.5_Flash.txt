Western corn rootworm (WCR) activity and damage are significantly influenced by weather conditions.  Warm temperatures and adequate moisture are crucial for WCR development.  Warm soil temperatures above 50Â°F stimulate egg hatching, while rainfall is essential for larvae to develop and feed on roots.  Dry conditions can hinder larval development and reduce rootworm damage. However, prolonged drought can also stress corn plants, making them more susceptible to rootworm damage.  High temperatures can also affect adult beetle emergence and flight activity, potentially limiting the spread of the pest.  Understanding the relationship between weather and WCR activity helps farmers make informed decisions regarding pest management strategies. For example, during periods of favorable conditions for WCR development, farmers might consider using insecticide treatments or implementing crop rotation practices to minimize rootworm infestations.  By closely monitoring weather patterns and their impact on WCR populations, farmers can optimize pest management efforts and maximize crop yields.
