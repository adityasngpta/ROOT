Western Corn Rootworm (WCR) damage can be distinguished from other pests by examining both the roots and the above-ground parts of the corn plants. WCR larvae primarily target the roots, causing them to appear pruned or chewed, which can lead to lodging where the plants fall over due to weakened root systems. This root damage often results in a characteristic "gooseneck" appearance as the plants attempt to grow upright again. Above ground, adult WCR beetles feed on corn silks, which can interfere with pollination and result in poor kernel set. The beetles are yellow with black stripes or spots, depending on the gender. In contrast, other pests like the European Corn Borer or Corn Earworm typically cause damage to the stalks, leaves, or ears rather than the roots. By closely inspecting the roots for pruning and the silks for beetle presence, you can more accurately identify WCR damage and differentiate it from other pest issues.
