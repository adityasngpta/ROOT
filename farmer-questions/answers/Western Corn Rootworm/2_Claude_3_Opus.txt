To differentiate Western Corn Rootworm (WCR) damage from other pests, you should look for specific signs and symptoms. WCR larvae feed on corn roots, causing the plants to become stunted, weak, and prone to lodging (falling over). The root damage appears as pruning or tunneling, with the root tips often completely consumed. Adult WCR beetles can cause additional damage by feeding on corn silks, which may interfere with pollination and lead to poorly filled ears. Other pests, such as wireworms or white grubs, can also damage corn roots, but their feeding patterns differ. Wireworms create small, round holes in the roots, while white grubs consume the entire root system. To confirm WCR presence, dig up some affected plants and examine the roots for the characteristic pruning and tunneling caused by the larvae. Monitoring for adult WCR beetles during silking can also help identify the pest. If you're unsure about the cause of the damage, consult with a local extension agent or crop consultant who can help diagnose the issue and recommend appropriate management strategies.
