Providing a definitive economic threshold for Western Corn Rootworm control is difficult without considering your specific circumstances.  Factors like corn price, control costs, and the actual or predicted rootworm pressure in your area significantly influence the economic decision.  Generally, the threshold ranges from 0.5 to 1.0 larvae per plant found in a root dig. However, you should contact your local extension office or agricultural consultant.  They can provide localized recommendations based on historical pest pressure, current field conditions, and control costs, leading to a more informed, economical decision for your farm. Additionally, consider integrated pest management strategies like crop rotation and resistant hybrids to help manage Western Corn Rootworm populations and potentially reduce your reliance on insecticides.
