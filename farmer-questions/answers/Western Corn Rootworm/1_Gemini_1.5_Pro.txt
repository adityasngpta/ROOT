Western Corn Rootworm infestations can be identified in corn fields by carefully observing the roots and foliage. Initially, the feeding of larvae on roots leads to browning and pruning, making the roots appear stubby and distorted. As the damage progresses, affected plants may exhibit stunted growth and an inability to effectively absorb water and nutrients. This can result in wilting, particularly during hot and dry periods, and the plants may lean or lodge, especially in strong winds, due to a weakened root system.  Scouting for adult beetles, which are identifiable by their yellow stripes on wings for females and black coloration for males, during the early stages of corn growth is crucial. Their presence, especially in high numbers, can indicate a potential larval infestation in the soil, serving as an early warning sign.  Remember to scout your fields regularly and look for these signs to catch infestations early and prevent significant damage to your corn yield.
