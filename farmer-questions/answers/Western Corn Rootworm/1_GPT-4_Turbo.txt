Early signs of Western Corn Rootworm infestation in corn fields primarily include the appearance of small, slender, white larvae near the roots of corn plants, typically starting around late May to early June, depending on your location. As these larvae feed on the roots, you may notice signs of root damage such as brown scars or pruning of root hairs. Above ground, symptoms can be subtle initially but include wilting, stunted growth, and yellowing of leaves, particularly under drought conditions. Another key indicator is the presence of adult beetles, which are about 1/4 inch long and yellowish with black stripes (males) or more solid coloring (females), typically appearing by late June or July. These beetles can often be seen on the plants, feeding on the silk and pollen. Monitoring these signs early can help in timely management decisions to control the infestation effectively.
