Early signs of Western Corn Rootworm infestation in corn fields include yellowing and wilting of the corn plants, particularly during hot and dry conditions. You may also notice stunted growth and uneven plant height across the field. Upon closer inspection, the roots may appear pruned or tunneled, and you might find larvae feeding on the roots. Adult beetles, which are yellow with black stripes or spots, can be seen feeding on corn silks and leaves, causing further damage. Monitoring these signs early in the growing season is crucial for timely intervention and management of the pest.
