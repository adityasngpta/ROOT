Western corn rootworm (WCR) damage can be tricky to distinguish from other pests, but there are key differences to look for. WCR larvae feed on corn roots, causing stunted growth, wilting, and lodging. Look for irregular root pruning, which appears as chewed-off root tips or a ragged, uneven root surface. This is distinct from other rootworm species like the northern corn rootworm which often creates smooth, round feeding scars. Additionally, WCR larvae have a distinct "C" shape when viewed from the side, unlike other rootworm larvae which tend to be straighter.  You can further confirm WCR by examining the soil around your plants. WCR larvae will leave behind small, round, brown fecal pellets in the soil. If you find these pellets in combination with the characteristic root damage, it's highly likely you are dealing with WCR. Monitoring your fields for WCR early in the growing season and implementing preventative measures, such as planting resistant varieties and utilizing crop rotation, can help you effectively manage this pest.
