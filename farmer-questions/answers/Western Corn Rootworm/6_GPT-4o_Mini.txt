For effective Western Corn Rootworm control, the economic threshold typically recommended is around 5 to 8 larvae per plant at the time of planting or shortly after emergence. This threshold can vary based on factors such as the value of the crop, the cost of control measures, and the expected yield loss. If you find an average of 5 larvae per plant, it may be economically viable to implement control measures, especially if you anticipate high corn prices or if the infestation is severe. Additionally, consider the use of integrated pest management strategies, including crop rotation and resistant hybrids, to manage rootworm populations sustainably. Regular monitoring and timely intervention are key to minimizing economic losses while maintaining soil health and ecosystem balance.
