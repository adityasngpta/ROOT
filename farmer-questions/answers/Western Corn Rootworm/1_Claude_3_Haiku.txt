The early signs of a Western Corn Rootworm (WCR) infestation in corn fields can include stunted or wilting plants, lodging or leaning of corn stalks, and the presence of adult beetles. One of the first visible signs is often the presence of small, round holes or feeding scars on the corn leaves, which are caused by the adult beetles as they emerge and feed on the foliage. As the larvae hatch and begin feeding on the corn roots, the plants may appear stunted or wilted, especially during periods of drought or high temperatures, as the damaged roots struggle to provide adequate water and nutrients to the plant. Lodging or leaning of the corn stalks is another common symptom, as the weakened root system is unable to adequately support the plant. Farmers should regularly inspect their fields, particularly during the late vegetative and reproductive stages of the corn crop, to identify these early signs of WCR infestation and take appropriate management actions to minimize yield losses.
