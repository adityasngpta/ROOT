Western Corn Rootworm damage can be distinguished from other pest damage through several key characteristics. The most noticeable sign is the "goose-necking" or lodging of corn plants, where they bend at the base and grow in a curved shape. This occurs because the rootworm larvae feed on the corn roots, weakening the plant's ability to stand upright. You may also observe pruned roots when pulling up affected plants, with the root system appearing stunted or having a "buzz cut" appearance. Above ground, adult rootworms may be visible feeding on corn silks and leaves, causing a scraped or skeletonized appearance. Additionally, you might notice a pattern of damage across the field, with more severe symptoms in areas where corn has been continuously planted. Unlike some other pests, Western Corn Rootworm damage typically becomes apparent later in the growing season, often after tasseling. If you're unsure, consider setting up sticky traps to monitor adult beetle populations or digging up plants to inspect the roots for larvae. Comparing these symptoms with those of other common corn pests can help you accurately identify Western Corn Rootworm infestations and take appropriate management actions.
