The best time to scout for Western Corn Rootworms in your fields is typically from late June through early August, with peak activity usually occurring in July. During this period, adult beetles emerge from the soil and begin feeding on corn leaves and silks. It's important to start scouting when the corn plants are approaching the silking stage, as this is when the adult beetles are most likely to be present and visible. Regular scouting during this time frame will help you detect the presence of Western Corn Rootworms early, allowing for timely management decisions. Keep in mind that emergence patterns can vary slightly depending on your specific location and local weather conditions, so it's advisable to begin scouting a bit earlier and continue for a few weeks to ensure you don't miss the peak activity period. By monitoring your fields closely during this crucial time, you'll be better equipped to assess the severity of the infestation and determine if control measures are necessary to protect your corn crop.
