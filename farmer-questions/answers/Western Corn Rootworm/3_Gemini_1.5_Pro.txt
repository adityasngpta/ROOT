Scouting for Western Corn Rootworm adults is crucial for making informed management decisions the following year. The ideal time to scout is during the late summer, typically from late July to early August. During this period, the adult beetles are actively feeding on corn silks and leaves before laying eggs. This feeding period coincides with the time when corn is most vulnerable to silk clipping, which can significantly impact pollination and yield. By scouting during these crucial weeks, you can assess the adult population size and estimate the potential pressure from rootworm larvae in the following season. This information allows you to determine if and what control measures are necessary, such as crop rotation or insecticide applications, to protect your future crops.
