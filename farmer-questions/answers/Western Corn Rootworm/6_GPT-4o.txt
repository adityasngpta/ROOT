The economic threshold for Western Corn Rootworm (WCR) control varies depending on several factors, including the cost of control measures, the market value of the corn, and the expected yield loss due to the pest. Generally, the economic threshold is reached when the cost of damage caused by the WCR equals the cost of controlling the pest. For WCR larvae, a common threshold is when an average of 0.75 larvae per plant is found, as this level of infestation can cause significant root damage leading to yield loss. For adult WCR beetles, the threshold is typically around 0.75 beetles per plant per day during the silking period, as they can damage silks and interfere with pollination. It's important to regularly scout your fields and consider local extension service recommendations, as thresholds can vary based on regional pest pressure and environmental conditions. Implementing integrated pest management (IPM) strategies, such as crop rotation and using resistant hybrids, can also help manage WCR populations effectively.
