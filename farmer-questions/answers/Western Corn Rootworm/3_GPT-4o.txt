The best time to scout for Western Corn Rootworms in your fields is during the late spring to early summer, specifically from late June through early August. This period coincides with the adult beetles' emergence and peak activity. Scouting should be done weekly during this time to monitor the population levels effectively. Pay particular attention to the silking stage of corn, as adult beetles are often found feeding on corn silks, which can impact pollination. Early detection is crucial for implementing timely management strategies, such as applying insecticides or using crop rotation to disrupt the pest's life cycle. Regular scouting helps in making informed decisions to minimize damage and ensure sustainable pest management.
