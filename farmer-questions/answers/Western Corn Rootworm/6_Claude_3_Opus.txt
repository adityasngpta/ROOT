When considering economic thresholds for Western Corn Rootworm (WCR) control, it's important to assess the potential yield loss against the cost of treatment. Generally, if there is an average of 0.75 or more adult beetles per plant during the corn silking period, this indicates a potentially damaging population that may require treatment in the following year's corn crop. 

However, the economic threshold can vary depending on the value of the crop and the cost of the control method. If corn prices are high and control costs are relatively low, the economic threshold may be lower. Conversely, if corn prices are low and control costs are high, the threshold may be higher.

It's also crucial to monitor WCR populations throughout the growing season using sticky traps or visual inspection. If you notice a significant increase in adult beetles or larval damage, it may be necessary to adjust your management strategy. Crop rotation to a non-host crop, such as soybeans, can be an effective way to break the WCR life cycle and reduce populations below economic thresholds.

Consult with your local extension office or a certified crop advisor to determine the most appropriate economic thresholds for your specific situation, considering factors such as your location, crop value, and available control options. They can provide personalized recommendations based on the latest research and local conditions to help you make informed decisions for managing Western Corn Rootworm in your fields.
