Western Corn Rootworm larvae are primarily controlled by beneficial soil-dwelling organisms that attack the various life stages of the pest. These natural enemies include a variety of predators like ground beetles, rove beetles, and wolf spiders, which consume rootworm eggs and larvae in the soil. Parasitic wasps, such as the ones from the *Diaparsis* and *Anaphes* genera, are also effective, laying their eggs inside rootworm eggs or larvae, ultimately killing them. Additionally, entomopathogenic nematodes, specifically those from the *Steinernema* and *Heterorhabditis* genera, offer another line of biological control. These microscopic worms penetrate rootworm larvae and release bacteria that rapidly multiply and kill the pest from within. Encouraging a diverse ecosystem with healthy populations of these natural enemies through practices like cover cropping and reduced tillage can significantly contribute to the suppression of Western Corn Rootworm populations.
