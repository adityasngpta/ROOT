Bt corn hybrids have been an important tool in managing Western Corn Rootworm (WCR) populations, but their effectiveness has varied over time. Initially, Bt corn provided excellent control against WCR, significantly reducing root damage and yield losses. However, in recent years, there have been increasing reports of WCR resistance to certain Bt traits, particularly in areas with continuous corn production and repeated use of the same Bt technology. This resistance development has reduced the overall effectiveness of some Bt hybrids against WCR. To maintain efficacy, it's crucial to implement an integrated pest management approach that includes crop rotation, use of multiple Bt traits or pyramided hybrids, and monitoring for signs of resistance. While Bt corn remains a valuable tool, its effectiveness now depends on proper management practices and the specific Bt traits used. Farmers should consult with local extension specialists to determine the most effective Bt hybrids for their region and consider incorporating other control methods to ensure long-term WCR management success.
