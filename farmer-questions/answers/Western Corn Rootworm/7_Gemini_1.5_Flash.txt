Crop rotation is a crucial tool in managing Western Corn Rootworm (WCR) populations. WCR larvae are highly specialized feeders, primarily feeding on corn roots.  By rotating corn with non-host crops, such as soybeans, alfalfa, or small grains, you disrupt the WCR's life cycle, significantly reducing their population. This is because WCR adults lay eggs exclusively in cornfields, and their larvae can only survive and develop on corn roots.  When corn is not present in the rotation, the WCR population is unable to reproduce and build up in numbers. The longer the rotation period, the more effective it is in suppressing WCR populations. A 3- to 4-year rotation is recommended to achieve optimal control, preventing the build-up of WCR populations and minimizing the need for chemical insecticide treatments. This approach helps to maintain a sustainable farming system by reducing pesticide reliance and protecting beneficial insects and the environment.
