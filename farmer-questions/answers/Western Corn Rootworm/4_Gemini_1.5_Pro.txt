Bt corn hybrids have been a valuable tool for managing Western Corn Rootworm pressure. These genetically modified varieties produce proteins derived from the bacterium *Bacillus thuringiensis* (Bt), which are toxic to the rootworm larvae. While initially highly effective, some Western Corn Rootworm populations have developed resistance to certain Bt proteins, particularly Cry3Bb1 and mCry3A, making them less effective in some regions. It's crucial to note that different Bt corn hybrids express different combinations of Bt proteins, and some are still highly effective against resistant populations. For instance, hybrids with pyramided traits like Cry34/35Ab1 and Vip3A continue to offer robust protection.  Therefore, selecting the right Bt hybrid is crucial for effective management. Farmers should consult local extension services or seed representatives to determine which hybrids are best suited for their specific area and consider rotating Bt traits to delay resistance development. Additionally, integrating other management practices like crop rotation and insecticide applications can further enhance rootworm control.
