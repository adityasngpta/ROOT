The best time to scout for Western Corn Rootworms (WCR) in your fields is during the late vegetative and reproductive stages of the corn crop, typically from late June through August. This is when the adult WCR beetles emerge and begin feeding on the corn plants. Scouting during this period allows you to monitor the population levels and assess the potential for larval damage to the root system in the following growing season. When scouting, focus on examining the lower leaves, leaf axils, and silks of the corn plants, as this is where the adult beetles tend to congregate. Additionally, you can use yellow sticky traps or other monitoring methods to get a better understanding of the WCR population dynamics in your fields. Timely scouting and monitoring will help you make informed decisions about the need for potential control measures, such as crop rotation or the use of insecticides, to effectively manage this significant corn pest.
