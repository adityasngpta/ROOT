Western Corn Rootworm (WCR) damage in corn can be differentiated from other pests primarily by examining the root system and observing the feeding patterns. WCR larvae typically feed on the roots of corn plants, causing noticeable root pruning and scarring. This damage can lead to the characteristic "goose-necking" or lodging of corn plants, where the stem bends near the soil surface because the root system can no longer support the plant upright. In contrast, other common pests like corn borers feed within the stalks, creating visible tunnels, while wireworms leave small, round holes in roots and may also attack seeds and seedlings. To confirm WCR presence, look for small, white larvae with brown heads in the soil near the roots or adult beetles on the plants later in the season. Effective management includes crop rotation, use of Bt corn varieties, and soil-applied insecticides. Regular scouting and identifying the specific type of damage are crucial for choosing the appropriate control strategy.
