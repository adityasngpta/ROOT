The best time to scout for Western Corn Rootworms is during the silk stage of corn development, which typically occurs in July and August. This is when adult beetles emerge from the soil and begin feeding on corn silks, which can interfere with pollination and lead to reduced kernel set. Scouting should be done weekly during this period, particularly in fields with a history of rootworm damage or continuous corn production.

When scouting, examine the ear zone (the area around the ear leaf) and count the number of adult beetles per plant. If you find an average of 0.75 to 1 beetle per plant, this indicates a potentially damaging population that may require management. Additionally, you can monitor for larvae by digging up corn roots during the late vegetative stages (V10-V12) to assess root damage. Economic thresholds for larvae vary by region, so consult with your local extension office for specific guidelines. By regularly scouting during these critical periods, you can make timely management decisions to minimize the impact of Western Corn Rootworms on your crop.
