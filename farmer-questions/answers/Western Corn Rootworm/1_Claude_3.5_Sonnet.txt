Early signs of Western Corn Rootworm infestation in corn fields can be subtle but important to recognize for timely intervention. One of the first indicators is the presence of adult beetles on corn silks and leaves, typically appearing in late June to early July. These small, yellowish-green beetles with black stripes may be observed feeding on corn foliage. Another early sign is the "goosenecking" or lodging of corn plants, where the stalks bend at the base due to compromised root systems. This occurs because the rootworm larvae feed on the corn roots, weakening the plant's ability to stand upright. Farmers may also notice patches of stunted or wilted plants in the field, as damaged roots struggle to uptake water and nutrients effectively. Additionally, if you dig up affected plants and examine the roots, you may find brown scarring or tunneling, which are clear indicators of rootworm feeding activity. It's important to monitor fields regularly and be aware of these early signs to implement control measures promptly and minimize crop damage.
