The economic threshold for Western Corn Rootworm (WCR) largely depends on the cost of control measures and the current price of corn. Generally, the economic threshold is set at about 0.75 beetles per plant during the peak beetle activity period, typically in late July to early August. This threshold means that if you count an average of 0.75 beetles per corn plant, it's economically justifiable to implement control measures to prevent significant yield loss. It's important to monitor beetle populations regularly and consider factors such as the history of WCR in the field, rotation practices, and the presence of Bt-resistant populations. Integrated pest management strategies, including crop rotation, use of Bt corn hybrids, and soil-applied insecticides, should be considered based on local conditions and resistance management guidelines. Always ensure that your management decisions align with the latest local extension recommendations and real-time monitoring data to optimize control and minimize unnecessary costs.
