Bt corn hybrids, which are genetically modified to produce insecticidal proteins derived from the bacterium Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt), have been shown to be highly effective against Western Corn Rootworms (WCR). Numerous studies have demonstrated that Bt corn hybrids expressing Cry3Bb1, mCry3A, or Cry34/35Ab1 proteins can provide excellent control of WCR larvae, reducing root damage and larval populations by 90% or more compared to non-Bt corn. This high level of control is achieved because the Bt toxins are expressed in the roots of the corn plant, which is the primary feeding site of WCR larvae. The Bt toxins disrupt the digestive system of the larvae, causing them to stop feeding and ultimately die. The use of Bt corn has been a valuable tool for farmers in managing WCR infestations and reducing the need for insecticide applications, thereby promoting more sustainable and environmentally-friendly pest management practices.
