Determining the economic threshold for Western Corn Rootworm (WCR) control requires considering several factors, including the specific corn variety, expected yield potential, and the cost of control measures. Generally, an economic threshold of 1-2 WCR larvae per plant is used as a guideline. This means that if you find 1-2 larvae per plant, it is likely economically beneficial to implement control measures. However, this threshold can vary depending on factors like the corn variety's susceptibility to root damage, the expected yield potential, and the cost of insecticides.  For instance, if you are planting a highly susceptible variety with high yield potential, you may want to lower the threshold to 0.5-1 larvae per plant. Conversely, if you are planting a resistant variety with a lower expected yield potential, you may increase the threshold to 2-3 larvae per plant. It's essential to consult with local extension services or agricultural experts to determine the most appropriate threshold for your specific situation. They can provide guidance based on your specific location, crop variety, and economic factors.
