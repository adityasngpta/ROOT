Bt corn hybrids, which are genetically engineered to produce insecticidal proteins from Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt), have been widely used to control Western Corn Rootworm (WCR) infestations. Initially, Bt corn hybrids were highly effective against WCR, significantly reducing root damage and yield losses. However, over time, some WCR populations have developed resistance to certain Bt proteins, diminishing the effectiveness of some Bt corn hybrids. The level of control provided by Bt corn hybrids depends on the specific Bt protein(s) expressed and the local WCR population's susceptibility. To maintain the effectiveness of Bt corn hybrids, farmers should implement integrated pest management (IPM) strategies, such as crop rotation, using hybrids with multiple Bt proteins targeting WCR, and monitoring for signs of resistance. Consulting with local extension agents and following recommended management practices can help farmers make informed decisions about using Bt corn hybrids as part of their WCR control strategy.
