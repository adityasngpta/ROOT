The best time to scout for Western Corn Rootworms is during the early to mid-summer, specifically from late June to early July. This period coincides with the peak egg hatch and larval activity, making it crucial for identifying infestations before they cause significant damage to your corn plants. During this time, you should inspect the root systems of your corn plants, looking for signs of feeding damage, such as root pruning or the presence of larvae. Additionally, monitoring for adult beetles can also be effective, as they typically emerge around the same time. Regular scouting during this window will help you make informed decisions about potential management strategies, such as insecticide applications or crop rotation, to mitigate the impact of these pests on your yield.
