Weather conditions significantly influence Western Corn Rootworm (WCR) activity and the extent of damage they cause to corn crops. Optimal conditions for WCR development are warm and moist soils. Eggs, which overwinter in the soil, typically begin to hatch when soil temperatures reach approximately 52째F (11째C), with peak hatching occurring when soil temperatures are around 70째F (21째C). Moist soil conditions favor larval survival and movement in the soil, allowing them to easily reach and feed on corn roots. Conversely, excessively dry conditions can reduce egg survival and larval mobility, potentially decreasing the severity of root damage. However, dry conditions can also stress the plants, making them more susceptible to damage and less able to recover from WCR feeding. Additionally, rainfall patterns influence egg laying and larval survival; moderate rains can facilitate these processes, while heavy rains may drown eggs and larvae. Understanding these dynamics can help in predicting WCR outbreaks and timing control measures effectively, such as soil insecticide applications or the use of WCR-resistant corn varieties.
