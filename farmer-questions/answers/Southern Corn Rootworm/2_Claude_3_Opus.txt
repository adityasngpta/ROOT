Southern Corn Rootworm (SCR) damage can be distinguished from other rootworm species by examining the feeding patterns and the timing of the infestation. SCR larvae feed on corn roots, causing tunneling and pruning of the root system, which can lead to plant lodging and yield loss. One unique characteristic of SCR damage is the presence of round, 1/8 inch diameter holes in the stalk just above the soil surface, caused by the larvae burrowing into the base of the plant. This damage typically occurs earlier in the growing season compared to other rootworm species, as SCR has an earlier egg hatch and larval development period. Additionally, SCR adults are small, pale green to yellowish beetles that do not cause significant silk clipping or leaf feeding like other rootworm beetles. By carefully examining the root damage, stalk holes, and timing of the infestation, farmers can distinguish SCR damage from other rootworm species and take appropriate management actions.
