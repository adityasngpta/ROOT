Yes, there are several corn varieties that exhibit resistance or tolerance to Southern Corn Rootworms (Diabrotica undecimpunctata howardi). One of the most effective methods of managing this pest is the use of genetically modified (GM) corn hybrids that express Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) toxins, which are lethal to the rootworm larvae. Bt corn hybrids with the Cry3Bb1, Cry34Ab1/Cry35Ab1, or mCry3A proteins have been shown to provide excellent protection against Southern Corn Rootworm damage. Additionally, some conventional non-GM corn varieties have been bred for increased tolerance to rootworm feeding, often through the development of stronger root systems that can better withstand larval feeding. Farmers should consult with their local extension services or seed providers to identify the most suitable rootworm-resistant corn varieties for their specific growing conditions and pest pressure levels.
