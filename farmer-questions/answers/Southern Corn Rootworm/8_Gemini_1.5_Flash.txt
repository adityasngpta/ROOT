Intercropping, the practice of growing two or more crops together in the same field, can potentially reduce Southern Corn Rootworm (SCR) infestations. While there's no single magic crop combination, certain intercropping strategies can contribute to reduced SCR damage. For instance, intercropping corn with non-host crops like soybeans can disrupt the life cycle of SCR. This is because SCR beetles prefer to lay eggs in cornfields, and having soybeans in the mix reduces the number of suitable egg-laying sites. Additionally, some non-host crops, like sunflowers, can attract natural predators of SCR, further aiding in pest control. However, it's crucial to choose intercropping partners that are compatible with corn in terms of growth habits and resource requirements. Furthermore, intercropping should be combined with other pest management practices like crop rotation, resistant varieties, and biological control for a comprehensive approach.
