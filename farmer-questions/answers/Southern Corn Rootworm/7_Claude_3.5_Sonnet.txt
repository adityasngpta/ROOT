Tillage practices can have a significant impact on Southern Corn Rootworm populations. Generally, conventional tillage methods that involve turning over the soil can help reduce rootworm populations by exposing eggs and larvae to harsh environmental conditions and predators. This disturbance of the soil can destroy overwintering sites and disrupt the life cycle of the pest. However, it's important to note that while tillage can provide some control, it may not be sufficient on its own to manage severe infestations.

Conservation tillage or no-till practices, on the other hand, may lead to increased Southern Corn Rootworm populations. These methods leave more crop residue on the soil surface, providing better overwintering habitat for the pest and potentially resulting in higher survival rates. Farmers using conservation tillage may need to rely more heavily on other control methods, such as crop rotation, resistant varieties, or targeted insecticide applications, to manage rootworm populations effectively. Ultimately, the impact of tillage on Southern Corn Rootworm should be considered as part of an integrated pest management approach, taking into account local conditions, crop rotation practices, and overall soil health goals.
