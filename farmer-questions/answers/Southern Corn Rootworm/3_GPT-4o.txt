The optimal time to scout for Southern Corn Rootworms, also known as Diabrotica undecimpunctata howardi, is during the late spring to early summer, specifically from late May through June. This period coincides with the larval stage of the rootworms, which is when they are most actively feeding on corn roots and causing damage. Regular scouting should be conducted weekly during this time to monitor the presence and density of the larvae. Pay close attention to the root systems of young corn plants, as this is where the larvae will be feeding. Early detection is crucial for implementing timely and effective management strategies, such as applying appropriate insecticides or considering crop rotation to disrupt the pest's life cycle.
