Southern corn rootworm feeding damage is often confused with damage caused by other rootworm species or even other soil-dwelling pests. To accurately distinguish Southern corn rootworm damage, carefully examine the roots. Look for signs of extensive feeding on the root hairs and outer root layers, giving the roots a pruned or stubby appearance.  You may also notice brown, scarred, or gouged areas on the roots.  While other rootworms can cause similar damage, Southern corn rootworms tend to inflict more severe feeding damage to the nodal roots, impacting the plant's ability to take up water and nutrients.  Additionally, monitor your fields for adult beetles and look for the characteristic light tan to pale green color and eleven black stripes on their wing covers.  Proper identification is crucial for implementing effective control measures. If you're unsure, consult with your local extension agent or agricultural advisor.
