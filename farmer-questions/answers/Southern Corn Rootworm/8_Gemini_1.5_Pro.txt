Intercropping can be a helpful tool in reducing Southern Corn Rootworm infestations, but its effectiveness depends on several factors and it's not a guaranteed solution.  This pest primarily targets corn, so intercropping with a non-host crop like soybeans or alfalfa can disrupt the rootworm's lifecycle. Essentially, by interspersing corn with these plants, you're making it harder for the adult beetles to find corn to lay their eggs in. This reduces the larval population that hatches and feeds on corn roots the following season.  However, the success of this strategy depends on choosing the right companion crop, the specific intercropping pattern, and the overall pest pressure in your area.  For example, simply planting a few rows of soybeans alongside a large cornfield might not be as effective as a more integrated and well-planned intercropping strategy. Additionally, if your area experiences high rootworm pressure, you might need to combine intercropping with other pest management practices like crop rotation or, in some cases, targeted pesticide application.  Remember, it's important to consider your specific context, consult local agricultural resources, and potentially experiment on a small scale before implementing large-scale changes.
