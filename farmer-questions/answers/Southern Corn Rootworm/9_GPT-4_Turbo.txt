As of now, there are no corn varieties that are specifically bred to be resistant to Southern Corn Rootworms (Diabrotica undecimpunctata howardi). Managing this pest primarily relies on cultural practices, crop rotation, and the use of soil-applied insecticides. Crop rotation is particularly effective because Southern Corn Rootworms have difficulty surviving without a corn crop to infest. Additionally, planting corn after a non-host crop can significantly reduce the population of rootworms. For fields with a history of rootworm problems, using soil-applied insecticides at planting can provide effective control. Always consider integrated pest management strategies and consult local agricultural extensions for tailored advice and the latest control methods.
