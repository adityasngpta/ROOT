Yes, intercropping can be an effective strategy to reduce Southern Corn Rootworm infestations. This pest, also known as the spotted cucumber beetle, tends to be less severe in diversified cropping systems. Intercropping corn with non-host plants can disrupt the habitat and feeding preferences of the rootworm, making it harder for them to locate their preferred host plants. For example, interplanting corn with clover or alfalfa can attract beneficial insects that prey on the rootworm and other pests. Additionally, these cover crops can improve soil health and structure, further reducing the likelihood of pest infestations. It's important to choose companion plants that are compatible with corn and consider the overall management of the cropping system to ensure its effectiveness against Southern Corn Rootworm.
