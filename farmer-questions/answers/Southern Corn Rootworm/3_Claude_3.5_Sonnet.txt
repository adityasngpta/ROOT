The optimal time to scout for Southern Corn Rootworms in your fields is typically during the early to mid-summer months, usually from late June through July. This timing coincides with the peak activity of adult beetles, which emerge from the soil and begin feeding on corn leaves and silks. It's important to start scouting when corn plants are in the early vegetative stages, as this is when the larvae begin feeding on the roots. Continue monitoring through the silking stage, as adult beetles can cause significant damage to silks, potentially interfering with pollination. Regular scouting during this period will help you detect the presence of both larvae and adults, allowing for timely implementation of control measures if necessary. Keep in mind that local climate conditions and planting dates may slightly affect the optimal scouting window, so it's advisable to consult with your local agricultural extension office for more region-specific recommendations.
