Tillage practices can have a significant impact on Southern Corn Rootworm (SCR) populations in agricultural fields. Conventional tillage, which involves the mechanical manipulation of soil through plowing or disking, can disrupt the life cycle of SCR by exposing the eggs and larvae to unfavorable conditions, such as desiccation and predation. This can lead to a reduction in SCR populations compared to no-till or reduced-tillage systems. However, it is important to note that while tillage may provide some level of control, it should not be relied upon as the sole management strategy for SCR.

Conversely, no-till or reduced-tillage practices can create an environment that is more conducive to SCR survival. These practices leave crop residue on the soil surface, which can provide shelter and food sources for SCR larvae. The increased organic matter in the soil can also improve moisture retention, further supporting SCR development. As a result, farmers adopting no-till or reduced-tillage practices may need to be more vigilant in monitoring SCR populations and implementing additional control measures, such as crop rotation, the use of resistant varieties, or the judicious application of insecticides when necessary.

In summary, while conventional tillage can help reduce SCR populations, it is not a complete solution. Farmers should consider a comprehensive pest management approach that takes into account their specific tillage practices, crop rotation, and the use of other control methods to effectively manage SCR infestations and maintain the long-term sustainability of their farming operations.
