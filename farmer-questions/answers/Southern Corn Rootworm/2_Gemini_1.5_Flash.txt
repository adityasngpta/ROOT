Distinguishing Southern Corn Rootworm (SCRW) damage from other rootworms can be tricky, but there are key differences to look for. First, SCRW larvae prefer to feed on the roots of corn plants, causing damage that appears as irregular, ragged holes or tunnels, often with a "shredded" appearance. This is different from the smooth, round holes characteristic of Northern Corn Rootworm (NCRW) damage. Second, SCRW adults are smaller and more slender than NCRW adults, with a distinctive dark brown to black body and a white stripe down each wing cover. Finally, SCRW beetles often lay their eggs in the soil near the base of corn plants, resulting in clusters of eggs that can be found during scouting. Keep in mind that other rootworm species may also be present, so confirming the identity of the pest is crucial for effective management. Consulting with local agricultural specialists or submitting samples for identification can help ensure accurate diagnosis and proper treatment.
