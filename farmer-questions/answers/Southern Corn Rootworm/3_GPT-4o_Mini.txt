The optimal time to scout for Southern Corn Rootworms is during the early to mid-growing season, specifically from late June to early July. This period coincides with the peak egg hatch and larval activity, making it crucial to monitor your fields for signs of infestation. Look for symptoms such as root damage, which can be identified by examining the root system of corn plants for feeding scars or missing roots. Additionally, scouting should include checking for adult beetles, which typically emerge around this time and can be found on the foliage. Regular monitoring during this window will help you make informed decisions about potential management strategies, such as insecticide applications or crop rotation, to mitigate the impact of these pests on your corn crop.
