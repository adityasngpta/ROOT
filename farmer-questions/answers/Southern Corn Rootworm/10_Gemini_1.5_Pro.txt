Southern corn rootworms can be effectively managed with a multifaceted biological control approach that centers around natural predators and beneficial microbes.  Beneficial nematodes, specifically those from the Steinernema and Heterorhabditis genera, are highly effective as they penetrate and infect rootworm larvae in the soil. These nematodes can be applied through irrigation or as a granular treatment. Encourage the presence of natural predators such as ground beetles, rove beetles, and parasitic wasps by implementing strategies like beetle banks and flowering plant strips along field edges. These beneficial insects prey on rootworm larvae and eggs, further reducing their population. Incorporating fungal pathogens like Metarhizium anisopliae into the soil can also suppress rootworm populations. These entomopathogenic fungi infect and kill rootworm larvae, offering a natural control method.  Remember to consult with local extension services or agricultural experts for specific recommendations regarding biological control agents, as their efficacy can depend on various factors including environmental conditions and the specific pest pressure in your area.
