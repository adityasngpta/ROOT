Southern Corn Rootworm infestation in corn crops can be identified by several distinct signs. One of the primary indicators is the presence of larvae feeding on the roots, which can cause significant root damage. This damage often results in stunted plant growth and can make the plants more susceptible to lodging, where they fall over due to weakened root systems. Above ground, you might notice wilting or yellowing of the leaves, especially during hot and dry conditions, as the damaged roots struggle to uptake water and nutrients. Additionally, adult beetles, which are yellow-green with black spots, may be visible on the plants, feeding on leaves, silks, and pollen. Monitoring for these signs early in the growing season is crucial for managing and mitigating the impact of Southern Corn Rootworm on your corn crops.
