Southern corn rootworm infestations manifest in several ways throughout the corn plant's life cycle. Initially, you might observe adult beetles feeding on corn silks, often clipping them close to the ear tip, which can disrupt pollination and reduce kernel development. As larvae emerge, they primarily target the roots, causing significant damage.  Early signs of root injury include stunted growth and a yellowish discoloration of the leaves. Upon closer inspection, you'd likely find root systems riddled with brown lesions and tunneling, ultimately compromising the plant's ability to absorb water and nutrients. This root damage can lead to lodging, especially during strong winds or heavy rainfall, further impacting yield. In severe cases, root systems may be decimated entirely.
