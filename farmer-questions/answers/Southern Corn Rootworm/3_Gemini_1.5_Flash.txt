The optimal time to scout for Southern Corn Rootworms in your fields is during the V4-V6 growth stage of your corn plants, which typically occurs around mid-June in most regions. This is because the adult beetles emerge from the soil and start feeding on corn silks around this time, laying eggs that hatch into larvae that will feed on the roots. Early detection is crucial for effective management, as the larvae can cause significant damage to the roots, leading to stunted growth and yield loss. Look for signs of damage such as wilting, discoloration, and root pruning. You can also use traps to monitor the adult beetle population. Be sure to check your fields regularly, particularly during periods of high temperatures and humidity, as these conditions favor beetle activity.
