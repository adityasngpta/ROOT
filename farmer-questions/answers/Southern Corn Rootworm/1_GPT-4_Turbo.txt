Signs of Southern Corn Rootworm infestation in corn crops primarily include wilting, stunted growth, and yellowing of plants, which may not be immediately apparent until the damage is severe. The larvae, which are the damaging stage of the pest, attack the roots of the corn plants, causing them to become weak and less able to absorb water and nutrients. This can lead to plants that are easily uprooted or knocked over by wind (lodging). Additionally, you might observe root damage directly, characterized by brown scars or feeding tunnels. In severe cases, the root system may be significantly pruned, leading to poor nutrient uptake and reduced yields. Regular monitoring of the crop and soil around the root zone is crucial for early detection and management of this pest.
