Southern corn rootworm (SCRW) infestations can be difficult to detect until significant damage has occurred. However, there are several signs you can look for in your corn crops:

* **Wilting and Stunted Growth:**  SCRW larvae feed on corn roots, which can cause plants to wilt, especially during periods of drought. This wilting is often more pronounced in the afternoon. You may also notice stunted growth and uneven plant heights within the field.
* **Root Damage:**  Digging up corn plants and examining the roots will reveal the telltale signs of SCRW infestation. Look for root pruning (small, irregularly shaped cuts) and extensive root damage that may appear as chewed or shredded roots.
* **"Dead Heart" or "Whiptail":**  Heavy SCRW infestations can lead to "dead heart" or "whiptail" symptoms. These symptoms occur when the larvae damage the growing point of the plant, causing the developing stalk to die or fail to develop properly.  The plant may have a small, deformed ear or no ear at all.
* **Lodging:**  Weakened roots caused by SCRW larvae can make the corn plants more susceptible to lodging (falling over) during windstorms or heavy rainfall.
* **Premature Plant Death:**  In severe infestations, corn plants may prematurely die due to extensive root damage and nutrient depletion.

It's crucial to monitor your corn crops regularly throughout the growing season for these signs. If you suspect a SCRW infestation, consulting with a local extension agent or pest control professional can help you confirm the diagnosis and implement appropriate management strategies.
