Signs of Southern Corn Rootworm infestation in corn crops include stunted plant growth, yellowing or wilting of leaves, and the presence of root damage. Farmers may notice plants that are leaning or falling over due to weakened root systems, which can be observed by digging up the plants and inspecting the roots for feeding scars or missing root mass. Additionally, adult beetles are typically visible on the foliage, especially during the flowering stage of the corn. Look for small, round holes in the leaves, which indicate feeding activity. Monitoring for these signs early can help in implementing control measures, such as crop rotation, insecticides, or planting resistant hybrids, to mitigate the impact of this pest on your corn yield.
