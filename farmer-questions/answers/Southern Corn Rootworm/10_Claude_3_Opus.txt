Biological control methods can be an effective and environmentally friendly way to manage Southern Corn Rootworm (SCR) infestations. One of the most promising biocontrol agents is the entomopathogenic nematode, particularly species in the genera Steinernema and Heterorhabditis. These beneficial nematodes actively seek out and infect SCR larvae, releasing bacteria that kill the pest within a few days. Nematodes can be applied to the soil as a drench or through irrigation systems.

Another biological control option is the use of natural predators such as ground beetles (Carabidae) and soldier beetles (Cantharidae), which feed on SCR eggs and larvae. Encouraging these beneficial insects by providing suitable habitat and reducing broad-spectrum insecticide use can help suppress SCR populations.

Additionally, certain entomopathogenic fungi, such as Beauveria bassiana and Metarhizium anisopliae, have shown potential in controlling SCR. These fungi infect and kill the pest, and can be applied as soil drenches or seed treatments.

Integrating these biological control methods with other sustainable practices like crop rotation, planting resistant varieties, and maintaining healthy soil can provide effective long-term management of Southern Corn Rootworm infestations.
