The Southern Corn Rootworm, also known as the spotted cucumber beetle, is a common pest that can cause significant damage to corn crops. Some of the key signs of a Southern Corn Rootworm infestation in corn include wilting, stunted growth, and lodging or leaning of the corn plants. Farmers may notice the corn plants appear yellow or sickly, and the leaves may wilt or droop, especially during hot, dry weather. The roots of the affected plants may also appear damaged, with tunneling or scarring visible. Additionally, farmers may spot the adult beetles, which are green with black spots, feeding on the leaves or silk of the corn plants. Early detection of these signs is crucial, as it allows farmers to take prompt action to manage the infestation and prevent further damage to their corn crop.
