To distinguish Southern Corn Rootworm (SCR) damage from other rootworms, there are a few key characteristics to look for. SCR larvae feed on the roots of corn plants, causing them to appear stunted or wilted, with a reduced ability to take up water and nutrients. The larvae themselves are yellowish-white with a brown head capsule and can reach up to 1/2 inch in length. Damage from SCR is often characterized by the presence of numerous small, circular holes or tunnels in the roots, as the larvae burrow through the root system. In contrast, other rootworm species, such as the Western Corn Rootworm, tend to cause more extensive root pruning and damage, with larger, more irregular feeding patterns. Additionally, SCR larvae have three pairs of legs, while other rootworm larvae have only two pairs. By closely examining the root system and the characteristics of the larvae, you can better distinguish SCR damage from other rootworm infestations and implement the appropriate management strategies.
