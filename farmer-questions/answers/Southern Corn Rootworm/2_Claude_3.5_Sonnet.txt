Southern Corn Rootworm damage can be distinguished from other rootworm species by observing specific patterns and characteristics. Unlike Western and Northern Corn Rootworms, Southern Corn Rootworm larvae tend to cause more scattered feeding damage throughout the root system, rather than concentrating on the crown roots. You may notice small, round holes bored into the roots, and in severe cases, the larvae may tunnel into the base of the stalk. Additionally, Southern Corn Rootworm damage often appears earlier in the growing season compared to other species. Above ground, plants damaged by Southern Corn Rootworm may exhibit "goosenecking" or lodging, but this symptom can be less pronounced than with other rootworm species. It's also worth noting that Southern Corn Rootworm adults (spotted cucumber beetles) feed on corn leaves, silks, and kernels, leaving behind characteristic feeding scars, which is not typical of other rootworm species. To confirm the specific rootworm species, it's advisable to dig up affected plants and examine the larvae or consult with a local agricultural extension agent for a definitive identification.
