The economic threshold for Southern Corn Rootworm (SCR) control is an important consideration for farmers to make informed decisions and manage this pest effectively. The economic threshold refers to the pest population level at which the cost of control measures is justified by the expected yield loss prevented. For SCR, the economic threshold is generally around 0.5 to 1 larva per plant during the late vegetative to early reproductive stages of corn growth. At this level, the yield loss caused by SCR feeding on roots can outweigh the costs of implementing control strategies, such as insecticide applications or crop rotation. It's important to monitor SCR populations throughout the growing season and make control decisions based on scouting data and the established economic threshold. Exceeding the threshold indicates that control measures should be taken to prevent significant yield losses. Adhering to the economic threshold helps ensure efficient and sustainable pest management, minimizing unnecessary inputs while protecting crop productivity.
