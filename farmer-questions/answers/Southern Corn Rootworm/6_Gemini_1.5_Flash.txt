Determining the economic threshold for Southern Corn Rootworm (SCRW) control depends on several factors, including your specific crop, the expected yield, the cost of control measures, and the potential damage caused by SCRW.  Generally, economic thresholds for SCRW are based on the number of eggs or larvae per plant. However, there is no single "magic number" for all situations. You can use a combination of methods to monitor SCRW populations and determine if control is necessary. These methods include:

* **Scouting:** Regularly inspect your cornfields for signs of SCRW damage, such as wilting plants, stunted growth, or root damage. Look for rootworm beetles in the field during the growing season.
* **Trap cropping:** Plant a small area of a trap crop, such as a susceptible variety of corn, to attract SCRW beetles. You can then monitor the trap crop for beetle activity and estimate the overall population.
* **Soil sampling:** Collect soil samples from different areas of your field and count the number of SCRW eggs or larvae present. This method can provide a more accurate assessment of the overall population.
* **Degree-day models:** Use degree-day models to predict the emergence and development of SCRW larvae. This information can help you determine when to apply control measures.

Once you have gathered data on the SCRW population, you can use economic thresholds to determine if control is necessary. The economic threshold for SCRW control is the point at which the cost of control is equal to the potential loss from SCRW damage. For example, if the cost of insecticide application is $10 per acre and the potential loss from SCRW damage is $20 per acre, then the economic threshold would be 2 SCRW larvae per plant. If your field has more than 2 SCRW larvae per plant, then insecticide application would be economically justified.

It's important to remember that these economic thresholds are just guidelines. You should consult with a local agricultural extension agent or pest control expert to determine the most appropriate economic threshold for your specific situation. They can provide you with personalized advice based on the specific conditions in your region and your farming practices.
