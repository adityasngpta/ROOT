The optimal time to scout for Southern Corn Rootworms, also known as the spotted cucumber beetle, is shortly after corn emergence through the V6 stage (when the corn has six leaves). This period is crucial because the larvae are most active and damaging during these early growth stages of corn. Begin scouting your fields weekly from corn emergence to ensure you catch any early signs of infestation. Look for signs of feeding on roots and seedlings, and for the presence of adult beetles, which are yellow-green with twelve black spots on their backs. Early detection is key to managing these pests effectively, as they can cause significant damage to the root system, leading to stunted growth and potentially reduced yields.
