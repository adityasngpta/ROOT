When managing Southern Corn Rootworm (SCR) infestations, it's crucial to consider economic thresholds to ensure cost-effective control measures. The economic threshold for SCR varies depending on the crop growth stage and the level of infestation. Generally, for corn plants in the seedling stage (up to V2), the economic threshold is when 10% or more of the plants show signs of wilting, stunting, or leaf feeding. From V3 to V8 stages, the threshold increases to 15-20% of plants exhibiting damage symptoms.

To assess the infestation level, examine the root systems of affected plants for larvae and feeding damage. If the average number of larvae per plant exceeds 0.75 to 1.0, or if root pruning is significant (1.5 nodes or more destroyed), it may be economically justified to apply control measures. However, it's essential to consider the cost of treatment against the potential yield loss and crop value to make an informed decision.

Cultural practices such as crop rotation and planting resistant varieties can help reduce SCR populations. If chemical control is necessary, consult with local extension services or agricultural professionals to determine the most appropriate insecticide and application method based on your specific situation and regional guidelines. Timely scouting and adherence to economic thresholds will help optimize SCR management while minimizing unnecessary treatments and costs.
