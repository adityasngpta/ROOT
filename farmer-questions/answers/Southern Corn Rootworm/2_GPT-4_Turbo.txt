Southern Corn Rootworm, also known as the spotted cucumber beetle, can be distinguished from other rootworms primarily by examining the damage and the pest itself. Southern Corn Rootworm larvae cause damage by feeding on the roots of young corn plants, which can lead to reduced growth and sometimes plant death. This damage often appears as stunted growth, wilting, and poor root development. Unlike the Western or Northern Corn Rootworms, which typically create more distinct root pruning or eating patterns, Southern Corn Rootworm damage may not be as severe in terms of root destruction but can still significantly impact plant health.

Additionally, the adult Southern Corn Rootworm is a small, yellow-green beetle with twelve black spots on its back, making it visually distinct from the Western and Northern Corn Rootworms, which are generally solid colored (greenish-yellow for Western and green or tan for Northern). Observing these beetles around your crops can be a key indicator of their presence. To confirm the specific type of rootworm damage, consider the overall plant symptoms, root damage patterns, and the appearance of the adult beetles. For accurate identification and management strategies, consulting with a local extension service or crop specialist is recommended.
