Economic thresholds for Southern Corn Rootworm control can vary depending on several factors, including the growth stage of the corn, expected yield, and market prices. Generally, a common threshold used is when 25% or more of the plants show root pruning damage. However, it's important to note that by the time this damage is visible, significant yield loss may have already occurred. For a more proactive approach, many experts recommend using sticky traps to monitor adult beetle populations. A threshold of 2 beetles per trap per day over a week-long period can indicate the need for control measures. Additionally, if you're considering preventative treatments, such as seed treatments or at-planting insecticides, these are often recommended in fields with a history of rootworm problems or in continuous corn production. Keep in mind that these thresholds are guidelines, and it's always best to consult with your local extension office or crop advisor for recommendations tailored to your specific region and situation, as they can take into account local conditions and resistance patterns.
