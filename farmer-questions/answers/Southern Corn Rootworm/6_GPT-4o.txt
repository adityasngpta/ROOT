The economic threshold for Southern Corn Rootworm (Diabrotica undecimpunctata howardi) control in corn typically depends on the growth stage of the crop and the level of infestation. For seedling corn, the threshold is generally around 1 larva per plant, as young plants are more vulnerable to damage. For later growth stages, such as when the corn is in the V6 to V8 stage, the threshold can be higher, around 2 to 3 larvae per plant. Additionally, if you are using pheromone traps or sticky traps to monitor adult beetle populations, an economic threshold is often set at 0.75 to 1 beetle per plant. It's important to consider the cost of control measures and the potential yield loss when determining whether to take action. Regular scouting and monitoring are crucial to accurately assess pest pressure and make informed decisions. Implementing integrated pest management (IPM) strategies, including crop rotation and resistant hybrids, can also help manage Southern Corn Rootworm populations effectively.
