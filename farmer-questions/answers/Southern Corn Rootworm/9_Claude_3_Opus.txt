Yes, there are corn varieties that have been developed to be resistant against Southern Corn Rootworms (Diabrotica undecimpunctata howardi). These resistant varieties have been genetically engineered to express Bt (Bacillus thuringiensis) proteins, which are toxic to the rootworm larvae when they feed on the corn roots. Bt corn varieties have been widely adopted by farmers as an effective way to manage Southern Corn Rootworm infestations without the need for extensive insecticide applications.

When selecting a resistant corn variety, it is essential to choose one that is well-suited to your local growing conditions and has demonstrated effective resistance against the specific rootworm species present in your area. Consulting with your local extension office, seed company representative, or agricultural advisor can help you identify the most appropriate resistant corn varieties for your farm. It is also important to note that while Bt corn varieties offer significant protection against rootworms, they should be used as part of an integrated pest management (IPM) approach that includes crop rotation, scouting, and other cultural practices to ensure long-term effectiveness and prevent the development of resistant rootworm populations.
