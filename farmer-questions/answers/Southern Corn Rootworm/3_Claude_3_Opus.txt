The optimal time to scout for Southern Corn Rootworms (SCR) is during the early stages of plant growth, typically from plant emergence until the plants reach about 12 inches in height. This period usually falls between late spring and early summer, depending on your location and planting time.

It's crucial to monitor your fields closely during this time, as SCR larvae can cause significant damage to the roots and base of the corn plants. Look for signs of wilting, stunted growth, or plants that are easily pulled from the soil due to root damage. You may also notice adult beetles feeding on the leaves.

Regularly check the soil around the base of the plants for larvae or signs of tunneling. If you find an average of one or more larvae per plant, it may be necessary to apply an insecticide to protect your crop. However, the economic threshold for treatment may vary depending on factors such as the growth stage of the plants and the expected yield.

By scouting your fields diligently during this critical period, you can detect SCR infestations early and take appropriate management actions to minimize damage and protect your corn crop.
