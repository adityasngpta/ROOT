Yes, there are corn varieties that have been developed to be resistant to Southern Corn Rootworms. These varieties typically incorporate traits from genetically modified organisms (GMOs) that express specific proteins toxic to the rootworms, effectively reducing their populations and minimizing damage to the corn plants. Additionally, some conventional breeding programs have focused on developing hybrids with natural resistance traits. When selecting resistant varieties, it's important to consider local pest pressure, as well as crop rotation and integrated pest management practices, to enhance overall effectiveness and sustainability. Always consult with local agricultural extension services or seed suppliers for the most suitable options for your specific region and conditions.
