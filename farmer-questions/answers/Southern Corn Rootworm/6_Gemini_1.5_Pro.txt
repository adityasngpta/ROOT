Economic thresholds are crucial for making informed pest management decisions in corn. For Southern Corn Rootworm, the threshold isn't based on a specific number of insects you see. Instead, it focuses on the potential damage to the corn plant, particularly the roots, which are the primary target of this pest. The most widely recommended economic threshold for Southern Corn Rootworm is based on the node-injury scale and recommends treatment when there is an average of one node of root damage per plant.  Scouting should be done during the larval stage when they are feeding on the roots.  Factors such as the value of your corn, the cost of control methods (insecticides, seed treatments, etc.), and the potential yield loss due to rootworm damage should all be considered. Additionally, consider your field's history: if you've had issues with Southern Corn Rootworm before, you might have a lower tolerance for damage. Consult with your local extension office or agricultural advisor for the most accurate and up-to-date recommendations tailored to your specific location and growing conditions.
