The optimal time to scout for Southern Corn Rootworms (SCR) in your fields is during the late spring and early summer months, typically from late May through July. This is the period when the adult beetles emerge from the soil and begin feeding on corn plants. Scouting during this timeframe allows you to monitor the presence and population levels of SCR, which is crucial for implementing effective management strategies. 

When scouting, focus on examining the base of the corn plants, as well as the soil around the plants, for the presence of adult beetles. Look for signs of feeding damage, such as ragged or missing leaves, as this can indicate the presence of SCR. Additionally, you can use pheromone traps to monitor the adult beetle population and track their activity in your fields. By regularly scouting and monitoring the SCR population, you can make informed decisions about the need for insecticide applications or other control measures to protect your corn crop from this significant pest.
