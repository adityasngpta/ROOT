Southern Corn Rootworm infestation in corn crops can be identified through several key signs. Above ground, you may notice patches of stunted or wilted plants, particularly during dry periods. These plants may appear yellowish or purplish due to nutrient deficiencies caused by root damage. The corn stalks might also exhibit a characteristic "goosenecking" or lodging, where they bend near the base and grow at an angle as the damaged roots struggle to support the plant. Underground, the most definitive sign is the presence of tunneling and scarring on the roots, often accompanied by secondary root rot. You may also observe the small, white larvae feeding on the roots if you carefully dig up and examine affected plants. Adult beetles, which are yellowish-green with black spots, may be visible on the plants, although their presence alone doesn't necessarily indicate an infestation. It's important to monitor your corn crops regularly and look for these signs, especially in areas with a history of rootworm problems, to catch infestations early and implement appropriate management strategies.
