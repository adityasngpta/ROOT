To optimally scout for Southern Corn Rootworm adults and assess the potential risk for egglaying and subsequent larval damage in the following season, you should plan your scouting activities around the time when corn plants are flowering, typically from late June to mid-July.  This is when the adult beetles are most active and present in the field as they feed on pollen and silks. This timing allows you to monitor their population levels and make informed decisions about crop rotation, insecticide applications, or other management strategies for the following season based on the observed infestation levels.
