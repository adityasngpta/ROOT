Tillage can significantly impact Southern Corn Rootworm populations by disrupting their life cycle and habitat. This agricultural practice involves turning over the soil, which can destroy the rootworm larvae and pupae that reside in the soil, thereby reducing their numbers. Additionally, tillage can expose these pests to predators and environmental conditions that they might not survive. However, the effectiveness of tillage in controlling Southern Corn Rootworm populations can vary depending on the timing and method used. For instance, deep tillage is generally more effective than shallow tillage because it buries the larvae deeper, making it harder for them to reach the surface and complete their life cycle. While tillage can be a useful tool in integrated pest management, it should be used judiciously to avoid soil erosion and degradation, and it is often most effective when combined with other pest control strategies such as crop rotation and the use of resistant corn varieties.
