The economic threshold for Southern Corn Rootworm, also known as the spotted cucumber beetle, varies depending on the crop stage and the potential for damage. For seedling corn, the general recommendation is to consider treatment if there is an average of one beetle per plant, especially if the plants are showing signs of feeding damage. For more mature corn, the threshold may be higher, as older plants can tolerate more damage. It's crucial to monitor the fields regularly from planting through the early growth stages. Economic thresholds can also be influenced by the current market value of corn and the cost of control measures. Always consider these factors when deciding on management strategies to ensure that the cost of control does not exceed the potential loss in yield due to pest damage.
