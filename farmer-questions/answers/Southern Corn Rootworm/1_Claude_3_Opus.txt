The signs of Southern Corn Rootworm (SCR) infestation in corn crops can be observed both above and below ground. Above ground, you may notice stunted plant growth, yellowing or wilting of leaves, and reduced overall vigor of the corn plants. This is due to the damage caused by the SCR larvae feeding on the roots, which impairs the plant's ability to absorb water and nutrients efficiently. In severe cases, you might even see plants falling over due to the extensive root damage.

Below ground, upon examining the roots, you will find SCR larvae feeding on the root system. The larvae are small, white to yellowish grubs with brown heads. As they feed, they create tunnels and cavities within the roots, significantly reducing the root mass. You may also observe brown, decaying roots as a result of the feeding damage. Additionally, secondary infections by fungi and bacteria might occur in the damaged areas, further compromising the plant's health. To confirm the presence of SCR, dig up some affected plants and carefully examine the roots for the presence of larvae and the characteristic feeding damage. Early detection of SCR infestation is crucial for timely management and minimizing yield losses in corn crops.
