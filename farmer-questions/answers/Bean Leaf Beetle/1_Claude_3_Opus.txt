The early signs of Bean Leaf Beetle infestation in soybean crops include small, round holes chewed in the leaves, typically starting at the leaf edges. These holes are usually about 1/8 inch in diameter and can be found on both the upper and lower leaf surfaces. As the infestation progresses, the feeding damage becomes more extensive, with larger, more irregular holes appearing on the leaves. In severe cases, the beetles may also feed on the pods and stems of the soybean plants.

Another early indicator of Bean Leaf Beetle presence is the appearance of the adult beetles themselves. Adult Bean Leaf Beetles are about 1/4 inch long and vary in color from yellow to reddish-brown, with black spots or stripes on their wing covers. They are most active during the day and can be found feeding on the leaves or hiding in the plant canopy.

Scouting for these early signs of Bean Leaf Beetle infestation is crucial for timely management decisions. Regularly inspecting soybean fields, particularly during the early growth stages, can help detect the presence of these pests before significant damage occurs. If the infestation reaches economic thresholds, farmers can consider various control measures, such as insecticide applications, to minimize crop damage and protect yield potential.
