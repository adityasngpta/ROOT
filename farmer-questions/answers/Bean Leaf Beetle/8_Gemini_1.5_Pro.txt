Crop rotation is a powerful tool for managing Bean Leaf Beetle populations. These pests primarily feed on legumes like soybeans and dry beans. By rotating to a non-legume crop like corn or wheat the following season, you disrupt their life cycle. Bean Leaf Beetles overwinter in crop residue, and when they emerge in the spring, they are faced with a lack of suitable food sources in a non-legume field. This reduces their ability to reproduce and survive, leading to lower pest populations in subsequent years when you rotate back to legumes. For optimal effectiveness, rotate crops for at least two years before planting legumes again.
