Bean leaf beetles can be serious pests, but several natural predators can help keep their populations in check.  Predatory stink bugs, including the spined soldier bug and the anchor bug, are voracious predators that attack bean leaf beetle eggs and larvae. Similarly, lady beetles, both adults and larvae, consume large numbers of bean leaf beetle eggs and aphids.  Minute pirate bugs are tiny but mighty predators that feed on the eggs and young larvae of bean leaf beetles.  Parasitic wasps, like tachinid flies, are also beneficial insects as they lay their eggs on or in bean leaf beetle larvae, ultimately killing them.  By attracting and conserving these natural enemies in your fields through practices like providing diverse habitats and avoiding broad-spectrum insecticides, you can encourage natural biological control of bean leaf beetle populations and reduce the need for chemical interventions.
