While no soybean varieties are completely resistant to Bean Leaf Beetles, some exhibit more tolerance and defense mechanisms. These varieties often possess traits like hairy leaves, which can deter beetles and reduce feeding damage. Additionally, planting later in the season might help avoid peak beetle populations, minimizing infestation risks.  It's crucial to contact your local agricultural extension office or a qualified agronomist for specific recommendations on resistant varieties best suited for your region and planting practices. They can provide the most up-to-date information on available soybean varieties and integrated pest management strategies for effective Bean Leaf Beetle control in your specific area.
