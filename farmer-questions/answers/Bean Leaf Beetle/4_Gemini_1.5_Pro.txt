Bean leaf beetles are a significant pest for soybean farmers.  You can implement several cultural practices to reduce their populations and minimize crop damage.  First, consider rotating your crops with non-host plants like corn or wheat to disrupt their lifecycle and reduce their overwintering sites.  Delaying soybean planting can also help avoid peak beetle emergence and subsequent infestations.  Choosing resistant soybean varieties, when available, can further diminish their impact.  Maintaining healthy soil through proper fertilization and irrigation can help your soybeans better withstand and recover from beetle attacks. Finally, inspect your fields regularly and accurately identify bean leaf beetles to make timely decisions about additional control measures.
