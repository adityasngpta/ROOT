Bean leaf beetles can significantly impact soybean yield, so early identification is crucial for timely management. Initially, you'll notice small, round holes appearing on leaves, primarily between the veins, giving the foliage a lace-like appearance. These holes result from the adult beetles chewing on the leaves. As the infestation progresses, the affected leaves may become skeletonized, leaving behind only a network of veins.  Additionally, look for small, yellowish-green, elongated eggs deposited in clusters on the undersides of leaves. These signs indicate an active infestation, urging the need for immediate scouting and potential control measures to protect your soybean crop.
