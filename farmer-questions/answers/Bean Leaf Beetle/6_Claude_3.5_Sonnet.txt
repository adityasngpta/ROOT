When determining thresholds for Bean Leaf Beetle control in soybeans, several factors should be considered. Generally, insecticide application is recommended when defoliation reaches 30% before bloom or 20% between bloom and pod fill. For seedling soybeans, treatment may be warranted if there are 5 or more beetles per plant and 1 cotyledon is destroyed per foot of row. During pod development, consider spraying if there are 10 or more beetles per sweep and 5-10% of pods show feeding injury. However, it's important to note that these thresholds can vary depending on the crop's growth stage, overall plant health, and environmental conditions. Regular scouting and monitoring of your soybean fields is crucial to accurately assess beetle populations and damage levels. Always consult with your local extension office or crop advisor to fine-tune these thresholds based on your specific region and growing conditions, as they may have more localized recommendations that take into account factors such as crop value, cost of treatment, and potential yield loss.
