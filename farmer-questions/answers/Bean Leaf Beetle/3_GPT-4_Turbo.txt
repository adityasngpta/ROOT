The optimal time to scout for Bean Leaf Beetles in your fields is shortly after soybean emergence, typically in late spring to early summer. This is when the first generation of adults, which have overwintered in nearby wooded areas or grassy field margins, begin to emerge and feed on young soybean plants. It's crucial to monitor your fields during this period as early feeding damage can significantly impact plant health and yield. Additionally, a second scouting should occur in late summer to early fall to assess the presence of the second generation of beetles, which can also cause considerable damage to the foliage and pods. Regular scouting during these times helps in making timely decisions regarding the need for control measures to prevent significant crop loss.
