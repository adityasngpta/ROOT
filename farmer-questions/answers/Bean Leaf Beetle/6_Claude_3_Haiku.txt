To determine if insecticide application is necessary for controlling Bean Leaf Beetles, you should consider the economic threshold, which is the pest population level at which the cost of control measures is justified by the expected yield loss. For Bean Leaf Beetles, the economic threshold is generally around 30-40% defoliation during the vegetative growth stages, or 20% defoliation during the reproductive stages. Monitor your bean fields regularly and assess the level of beetle infestation and defoliation. If the infestation reaches the economic threshold, then insecticide application may be warranted to prevent significant yield loss. However, it's important to consider other factors as well, such as the growth stage of the crop, weather conditions, and the presence of natural enemies that may help control the beetle population. Consult with your local extension service or agricultural experts to determine the most appropriate thresholds and management strategies for your specific situation.
