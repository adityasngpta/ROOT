Bean Leaf Beetle infestations in soybean crops can be identified by several early signs. The most noticeable indicator is the presence of small, round holes in the leaves, giving them a shot-hole appearance. These feeding holes are typically about 1/8 inch in diameter and are scattered across the leaf surface. You may also observe yellowing or browning of leaves, particularly around the feeding sites. Adult beetles, which are about 1/4 inch long and vary in color from yellow to reddish-brown with black spots, can often be found on the undersides of leaves or along plant stems. In seedling stages, look for cotyledon damage and potential stand reduction. As the season progresses, you might notice scarring on the pod surface caused by adult feeding. Early detection of these signs is crucial for implementing timely control measures and preventing significant crop damage.
