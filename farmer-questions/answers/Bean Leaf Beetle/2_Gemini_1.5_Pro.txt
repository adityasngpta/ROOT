Bean leaf beetles leave behind distinct feeding damage on bean plants that sets them apart from other pests. These beetles create round or semi-circular holes in the leaves, often chewing from the leaf edges inward.  You'll often find this damage concentrated at the top of the plant first, as adults typically emerge in early spring and target young bean seedlings. As the season progresses and larvae emerge, you might notice additional damage to the roots and pods. A telltale sign of bean leaf beetles is their excrement; look for small, black, cylindrical droppings on the leaves.  While other pests like Japanese beetles also create holes in leaves, they tend to be larger and more irregular. Additionally, bean leaf beetle adults have a hard shell and come in various colors ranging from reddish-brown to yellow, often with black markings, making them visually identifiable.
