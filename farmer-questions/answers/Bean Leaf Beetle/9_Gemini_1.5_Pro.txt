Cover crops can be a helpful tool in managing Bean Leaf Beetle infestations, but their effectiveness depends on various factors and requires a strategic approach.  Cover crops like cereal rye or wheat, planted after the harvest of your bean crop, can reduce the overwintering success of Bean Leaf Beetles by making the soil less hospitable. Additionally, these cover crops can attract beneficial insects like ground beetles that prey on Bean Leaf Beetle larvae and pupae in the soil. However, it's crucial to terminate your cover crop at least two weeks before planting your bean crop. This timing is essential because Bean Leaf Beetles are attracted to actively growing plant matter and could be drawn to your cash crop if the cover crop is still green and lush.  Furthermore, choosing cover crops that don't belong to the legume family is important, as these could potentially host Bean Leaf Beetle populations.  Remember that while cover crops can contribute to a comprehensive pest management strategy, they are most effective when combined with other tactics like crop rotation, resistant bean varieties, and potentially, targeted insecticide applications.
