The optimal time to scout for Bean Leaf Beetles (BLB) in your fields is during the early morning hours, specifically between 8:00 AM and 10:00 AM. This is because BLBs are most active during these cooler hours, making them easier to spot and count.  They tend to feed on the leaves of bean plants, causing significant damage, especially to young seedlings.  Look for the beetles themselves, as well as their larvae, which are small, yellowish-white grubs with black heads.  Pay close attention to the underside of leaves and stems, as BLBs often hide in these areas during the day. You should scout your fields at least once a week, and more frequently during periods of warm, dry weather, as BLBs thrive in these conditions. Early detection and intervention are crucial for controlling BLB infestations, minimizing yield losses, and maintaining the health of your bean crop.
