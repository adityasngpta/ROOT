Bean leaf beetles are a common pest of bean crops, and their damage can be easily confused with other insect pests. To accurately identify bean leaf beetle damage, look for **skeletonized leaves**, meaning that the beetles have eaten away the leaf tissue between the veins, leaving a lacey, translucent appearance. This distinctive feeding pattern is a key indicator of bean leaf beetle activity. Other pests may cause similar damage, but they usually leave **holes or irregular notches in the leaves**.  In addition to skeletonized leaves, you may also find **small, round holes in the pods** caused by the beetles.  If you find these signs, you can be confident that you are dealing with bean leaf beetles.  

To further confirm your diagnosis, you can look for **the beetles themselves**. Adults are about 1/4 inch long and have a metallic blue or green color with black markings. They are often found on the underside of leaves.  Larvae are yellowish-brown and have black heads. They feed on the underside of leaves and can be identified by their characteristic "C" shape. 

Once you have confirmed that you have bean leaf beetles, you can take steps to control them. **Cultural control methods**, such as rotating crops, planting early-maturing varieties, and using row covers, can be effective in reducing populations. **Chemical control** is also an option, but it should be used as a last resort.  Always choose insecticides that are specifically labeled for bean leaf beetles and follow the label instructions carefully.
