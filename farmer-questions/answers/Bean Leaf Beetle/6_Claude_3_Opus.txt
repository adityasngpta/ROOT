When deciding if insecticide application is necessary for Bean Leaf Beetle control, it's important to consider the growth stage of your soybean crop and the level of beetle infestation. During the early seedling stages (VC - first trifoliate), treatment is recommended if you observe 16 or more beetles per foot of row. For V2+ stage soybeans, the threshold increases to 39 beetles per foot of row. 

Once the crop reaches the pod-setting and pod-filling stages (R3-R4), the economic threshold changes. At this point, control is justified if 5-10% of the pods are damaged and the beetles are still present in the field. It's crucial to assess pod damage, as this directly correlates to yield loss.

Keep in mind that these thresholds serve as guidelines, and other factors such as the cost of treatment, expected crop yields, and market value should also be considered when making treatment decisions. Regularly scouting your fields is key to monitoring beetle populations and crop damage levels, enabling you to make timely and informed pest management choices to protect your soybean yield.
