To determine if insecticide application is necessary for controlling Bean Leaf Beetles in your bean crops, you should monitor the population density and the extent of damage. Economic thresholds vary depending on the growth stage of the beans. For early vegetative stages, consider treatment if you find an average of 2 beetles per plant or if defoliation exceeds 30%. During the pod formation and filling stages, the threshold is lower; you should consider insecticide application if you observe an average of 1 beetle per plant or if 10% of the pods show feeding damage. Regular scouting and accurate assessment of beetle numbers and damage are crucial to making informed decisions, ensuring that insecticide use is both economically justified and environmentally responsible.
