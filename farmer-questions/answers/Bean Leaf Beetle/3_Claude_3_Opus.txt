The optimal time to scout for Bean Leaf Beetles in your fields is during the early stages of plant development, particularly from the time of plant emergence to the establishment of the first trifoliate leaves. This period usually occurs in the late spring or early summer, depending on your location and planting time.

It is crucial to monitor your fields regularly during this time, as Bean Leaf Beetles can cause significant damage to young soybean plants. Adult beetles feed on the cotyledons, leaves, and stems, while larvae feed on the roots and nodules. Scouting should be done at least once a week, especially during warm, sunny days when the beetles are most active.

When scouting, examine the plants carefully for the presence of adult beetles, which are usually yellow, tan, or red with black spots or stripes. Also, look for signs of feeding damage, such as small, round holes in the leaves. If the infestation reaches the economic threshold (e.g., 16 beetles per foot of row in soybeans), consider implementing control measures, such as insecticide applications, to minimize crop damage and yield loss.
