The optimal time to scout for Bean Leaf Beetles in your fields is during the early stages of plant emergence and throughout the growing season. Begin scouting as soon as the soybean plants start to emerge, as Bean Leaf Beetles are most active and can cause significant damage to young plants. Continue monitoring regularly, especially during the early vegetative stages (V1 to V3), as this is when the beetles are most likely to feed on the cotyledons and first true leaves. Pay particular attention to the undersides of leaves and the soil surface around the plants, as beetles often hide there. Regular scouting will help you detect infestations early and take timely action to manage the pest population effectively.
