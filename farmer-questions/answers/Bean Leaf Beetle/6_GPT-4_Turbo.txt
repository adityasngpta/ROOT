For managing Bean Leaf Beetle in soybeans, it's crucial to consider both the growth stage of the crop and the extent of the infestation. Generally, insecticide application is recommended when there is significant defoliation—about 30% before bloom and 20% between bloom and pod fill—and the presence of beetles is ongoing. Additionally, during the pod-fill stage, treatment should be considered if there are more than 10 beetles per foot of row and there is evidence of pod feeding. It's also important to scout fields regularly, starting early in the season when the first beetles typically appear as soybeans emerge. Decisions should be based on current beetle populations and the observed damage, rather than historical problems alone, to avoid unnecessary applications and to promote integrated pest management practices.
