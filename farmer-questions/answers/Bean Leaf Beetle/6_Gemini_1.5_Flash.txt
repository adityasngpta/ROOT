Deciding when to apply insecticide for Bean Leaf Beetle control requires careful consideration of several factors, including the stage of your bean crop and the beetle population density.  For early-season infestations, when bean plants are still small and vulnerable, even a few beetles per plant can cause significant damage.  In this case, insecticide application is generally recommended if you find an average of one beetle per plant or more.  As the crop grows, the threshold for insecticide application increases.  For mature bean plants, you can tolerate a higher beetle population density, around 2-3 beetles per plant, without causing significant yield losses.  However, it's crucial to monitor the beetles regularly throughout the growing season. If you observe rapid population growth or significant leaf damage, insecticide application is necessary regardless of the threshold.  Always choose a product labeled for Bean Leaf Beetle control and follow the instructions carefully.  Consider using other integrated pest management practices, such as row covers or natural predators, to reduce reliance on insecticides.  By implementing a comprehensive approach to Bean Leaf Beetle control, you can minimize the risk of pest damage and ensure a healthy, productive bean crop.
