To differentiate Bean Leaf Beetle damage from other pests, you should look for the following key characteristics:

Bean Leaf Beetles create small, round holes in the leaves of bean plants, typically about 1/8 inch in diameter. These holes are usually scattered across the leaf surface and can be easily distinguished from the larger, more irregular holes caused by caterpillars or slugs. Additionally, Bean Leaf Beetles feed on the undersides of leaves, leaving the upper epidermis intact, which results in a lace-like appearance.

Another identifying factor is the presence of the beetles themselves. Adult Bean Leaf Beetles are about 1/4 inch long, oval-shaped, and can vary in color from yellow to reddish-brown. They often have black spots or stripes on their wing covers. The larvae, which feed on the roots and nitrogen-fixing nodules of the bean plants, are white, slender grubs found in the soil.

If you notice these signs of damage along with the presence of the beetles or larvae, it's likely that Bean Leaf Beetles are the culprits. Confirming the pest responsible for the damage will help you choose the most effective management strategies, such as using row covers, applying insecticides, or employing crop rotation to break the pest's life cycle.
