Early signs of Bean Leaf Beetle infestation in soybean crops include small, round holes in the leaves, which are typically the first visible damage. These beetles often feed on the undersides of leaves, so flipping the leaves over can help in spotting them. Additionally, you might notice defoliation, which can become more severe as the infestation progresses. The beetles themselves are small, about 1/4 inch long, and can be yellow, orange, or red with distinct black spots or stripes. Another sign to watch for is pod damage, as the beetles can chew on the pods, leading to scarring and potential entry points for diseases. Monitoring your fields regularly, especially during the early stages of plant growth, can help in early detection and management of these pests.
