Bean Leaf Beetle damage can be differentiated from other pests by closely examining the type of damage and the appearance of the beetles. Bean Leaf Beetles are small, oval insects, typically yellowish or reddish-brown with black spots or stripes on their wing covers. The damage they cause is quite distinctive; they chew small, round holes in the leaves of bean plants, often starting on the edges and moving inward. This contrasts with pests like spider mites, which cause yellow stippling, or aphids, which typically cause leaves to curl and can lead to a sticky residue from their honeydew. Additionally, Bean Leaf Beetles may also feed on the pods, scraping the surface and sometimes chewing through to the beans, which is not common with many other leaf-feeding insects. Observing both the pest and the pattern of damage can help accurately identify Bean Leaf Beetle infestations.
