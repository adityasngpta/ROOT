Early signs of Bean Leaf Beetle infestation in soybean crops include visible feeding damage on the leaves, which often appears as small, round holes. As the beetles prefer tender young foliage, the damage is typically more severe on the first true leaves of the soybean plants. You might also notice the beetles themselves, which are small (about 1/4 inch long), and can be yellow, red, or orange with black spots or stripes. Additionally, the presence of their larvae can be inferred from damage to the roots and nodules, which can affect the plant's nitrogen-fixing capabilities and overall vigor. Vigilant monitoring of these signs, especially during early growth stages, is crucial for timely management actions.
