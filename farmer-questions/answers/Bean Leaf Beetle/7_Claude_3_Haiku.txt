Yes, there are several soybean varieties that have been bred to be resistant or tolerant to Bean Leaf Beetles. Bean Leaf Beetles can cause significant damage to soybean crops, so using resistant varieties is an important management strategy. Some examples of soybean varieties with resistance or tolerance to Bean Leaf Beetles include Dairyland DSR-2400, Asgrow AG3432, and Pioneer P93M11. These varieties have been developed to have physical or chemical traits that make them less attractive or susceptible to Bean Leaf Beetle feeding and reproduction. Planting these resistant varieties can help reduce the impact of Bean Leaf Beetles on your soybean crop and minimize the need for insecticide applications. It's important to consult with your local extension office or seed supplier to determine which resistant varieties are best suited for your specific growing conditions and pest pressures.
