The optimal time to scout for Bean Leaf Beetles is during the early spring, particularly when the soybean plants are in the seedling stage, typically around the V1 to V3 growth stages. This is when the beetles emerge from overwintering and begin to feed on the young plants. Regular scouting should start as soon as the soybeans emerge and continue through the early growing season, as this is when the beetles are most active and can cause significant damage. Look for signs of feeding, such as small holes in the leaves, and monitor for adult beetle populations. If you find an average of 15% or more of the plants infested, it may be time to consider control measures to prevent further damage.
