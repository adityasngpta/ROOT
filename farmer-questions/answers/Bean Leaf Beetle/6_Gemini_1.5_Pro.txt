Deciding on insecticide application for bean leaf beetles should not be solely based on reaching a specific number of pests. Instead, consider a dynamic approach that weighs multiple factors.  Early in the season, when soybean plants are young and vulnerable, a lower threshold of 1-2 beetles per plant with noticeable defoliation (around 10% or more) might warrant treatment, especially if damage is actively increasing.  However, as plants mature and become more robust, they can tolerate higher levels of defoliation, often up to 30%, without impacting yield. During this later growth stage, focus on the presence of beetle clusters and actively feeding individuals rather than just a simple count.  Consistently monitor your fields throughout the season, assess the growth stage of your soybeans, estimate the actual damage to leaves, and factor in any beneficial insects present before making a spray decision.
