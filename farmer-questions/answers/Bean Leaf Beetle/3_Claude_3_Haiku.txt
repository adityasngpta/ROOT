The optimal time to scout for Bean Leaf Beetles in your fields is during the early vegetative growth stages of your bean crop, typically from emergence through the R3 (early pod) stage. Bean Leaf Beetles are a common pest that can cause significant damage to soybean and dry bean crops if left unchecked. They feed on the leaves, stems, and pods of the plants, reducing yield and quality. Scouting should be done regularly, at least once a week, to monitor the beetle populations and determine if treatment is necessary. The best time to scout is in the morning or evening when the beetles are most active. Look for the adult beetles feeding on the leaves and pods, as well as any signs of defoliation or pod damage. Keeping a close eye on your fields during this critical growth period will allow you to make timely and informed decisions about managing this pest effectively and minimizing its impact on your bean crop.
