Currently, there are no commercially available soybean varieties that are completely resistant to Bean Leaf Beetles. However, some varieties have shown moderate levels of tolerance to these pests. Tolerance refers to the ability of the plant to withstand or recover from damage caused by the beetles without significant yield loss. 

Research has identified certain soybean genotypes that exhibit antixenosis (non-preference) and antibiosis (adverse effect on insect biology) against Bean Leaf Beetles. These traits can help reduce the damage caused by the beetles. Farmers can consult with their local extension services or seed companies to identify soybean varieties that have shown better performance against Bean Leaf Beetles in their specific region.

It's important to note that managing Bean Leaf Beetles requires an integrated pest management (IPM) approach. This includes monitoring beetle populations, using economic thresholds for treatment decisions, employing cultural practices such as crop rotation and early planting, and judiciously using insecticides when necessary. Farmers should work closely with their local extension agents and crop advisors to develop a comprehensive IPM plan tailored to their specific needs and conditions.
