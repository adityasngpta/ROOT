Bean Leaf Beetle damage can be identified by several distinct characteristics. The most noticeable sign is the presence of small, round holes in the leaves of bean plants, which are typically uniform in size and scattered across the leaf surface. Unlike other pests that may cause irregular or jagged holes, Bean Leaf Beetles create more consistent, circular damage. Additionally, you might observe feeding on the pods, which can result in scarring and potential entry points for diseases. The beetles themselves are small, about 1/4 inch long, and can vary in color from yellow to red, often with black spots or stripes on their wing covers. Another distinguishing feature is the presence of a black triangle at the top of their wing covers, just behind the head. Monitoring your fields early in the season, especially during the seedling stage, can help you spot these beetles and their damage before it becomes severe. If you notice these specific signs, it is likely that Bean Leaf Beetles are the culprits, and you can then take appropriate management actions such as using insecticides or implementing crop rotation to reduce their impact.
