The optimal time to scout for Bean Leaf Beetles in your fields is typically during the early vegetative stages of soybean growth, particularly from emergence to the V4 stage. This period usually occurs within the first few weeks after planting, depending on your local climate and planting date. It's crucial to begin scouting early, as Bean Leaf Beetles can cause significant damage to young soybean plants. Continue monitoring throughout the growing season, with increased vigilance during pod development, as these pests can also feed on pods later in the season. Early morning or late afternoon scouting is often most effective, as the beetles are more active during these times. Remember to check both the undersides of leaves and the soil surface around plants, as Bean Leaf Beetles may drop to the ground when disturbed. Regular scouting will help you detect infestations early and make timely management decisions to protect your soybean crop.
