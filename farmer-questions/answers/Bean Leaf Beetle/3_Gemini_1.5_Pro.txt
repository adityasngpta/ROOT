Bean leaf beetles are a significant pest of soybeans and can cause considerable damage if not managed properly.  The optimal time for scouting for bean leaf beetles in your soybean fields is during two critical periods.  The first is early in the season, from the seedling stage through the V2 stage (when the second trifoliate leaf appears). During this time, overwintering adults emerge from hibernation and begin feeding on young soybean plants. Early detection of these adults is crucial as they can cause significant defoliation and transmit bean pod mottle virus.  The second critical scouting period is during late summer, from August to September, when the new generation of beetles emerges. These beetles feed on leaves and pods, potentially impacting both yield and seed quality. Scouting involves inspecting plants in various locations within the field for signs of the pest, including the presence of adults, eggs, or feeding damage.
