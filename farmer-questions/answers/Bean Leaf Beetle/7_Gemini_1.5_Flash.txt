Unfortunately, there are currently no soybean varieties that are completely resistant to Bean Leaf Beetles. While some varieties may exhibit some level of tolerance, the beetles can still cause significant damage to susceptible soybeans.  However, there are several strategies that can help you manage Bean Leaf Beetle populations and minimize their impact on your soybean crop. 

* **Planting resistant varieties:** While complete resistance is not available, some soybean varieties are considered "moderately resistant" and can tolerate higher beetle populations without significant yield loss. Look for varieties with the "BLB" or "Bean Leaf Beetle Resistance" designation when selecting your soybean seeds. 
* **Early planting:** Planting soybeans early in the season can help your crop get ahead of the beetles. Early-planted soybeans tend to have a faster growth rate and can better tolerate feeding damage from Bean Leaf Beetles. 
* **Crop rotation:** Rotating soybean crops with non-host crops can disrupt the life cycle of the beetles and reduce their populations. 
* **Scout your fields regularly:**  Regularly check your soybean fields for Bean Leaf Beetles.  Monitor the beetles' presence and the amount of damage they are causing. 
* **Consider insecticide applications:** If beetle populations reach a threshold that threatens your yield, you may need to consider applying an insecticide.  Contact your local extension office for specific recommendations on the most effective insecticides and application timing.

Remember, managing Bean Leaf Beetles effectively requires a multi-faceted approach, incorporating several of these strategies.  By implementing a combination of these techniques, you can minimize the damage caused by Bean Leaf Beetles and protect your soybean crop.
