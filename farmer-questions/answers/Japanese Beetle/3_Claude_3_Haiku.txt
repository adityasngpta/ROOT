The optimal time to scout for Japanese Beetles in ornamental plants is during the peak adult activity period, which typically occurs in mid-to-late summer, usually from June through August. Japanese Beetles are most active and visible during the warmest parts of the day, often between 10 AM and 4 PM. It's important to regularly inspect the foliage, flowers, and stems of your ornamental plants, as the adult beetles feed on the leaves, skeletonizing them and causing significant damage. Scouting early in the morning or late afternoon can also be effective, as the beetles may be less active during the hottest parts of the day. Regular monitoring and early detection are key to implementing effective management strategies, such as hand-picking the beetles, using pheromone traps, or applying targeted insecticides if necessary, to protect your valuable ornamental plants from Japanese Beetle infestations.
