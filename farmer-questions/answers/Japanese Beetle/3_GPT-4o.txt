The optimal time to scout for Japanese Beetles in ornamental plants is during the early morning or late afternoon, typically from late June through August, depending on your geographic location. These beetles are most active during warm, sunny days and tend to feed on plants during these times. By scouting during the cooler parts of the day, you can catch them when they are less active and easier to manage. Regular monitoring during this period is crucial, as early detection can help you implement control measures before the infestation becomes severe. Look for signs of feeding damage, such as skeletonized leaves, to identify their presence and take timely action.
