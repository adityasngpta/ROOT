Japanese beetles can cause significant damage to fruit trees, and recognizing the signs early is crucial for effective control. The most obvious sign is the presence of the beetles themselves. Adults are metallic green and copper-brown, about 1/2 inch long, and typically congregate in clusters on leaves and fruits, feeding on them throughout the day.  You'll notice leaves being skeletonized, meaning they eat the tissue between the veins, leaving a lace-like appearance. Severely damaged leaves will turn brown and may drop prematurely. Additionally, you might observe fruits being marred by irregular holes and pits, making them unmarketable. Keep a lookout for these signs, especially during the summer months when Japanese beetles are most active.
