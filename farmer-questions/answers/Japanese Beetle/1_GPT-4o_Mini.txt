Signs of Japanese Beetle infestation in fruit trees include noticeable leaf damage, characterized by a distinctive skeletonizing effect where the beetles consume the tissue between the veins, leaving a lace-like appearance. You may also observe the beetles themselves, which are about 1/2 inch long, with a metallic green body and coppery-brown wing covers. Additionally, you might find their larvae, known as grubs, in the soil around the base of the trees, which can cause further damage to the roots. Look for premature leaf drop, wilting, or overall decline in tree vigor, as these can also indicate stress from beetle feeding. Regular monitoring and early intervention, such as handpicking the beetles or applying appropriate insecticides, can help manage the infestation effectively.
