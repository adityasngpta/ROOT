The signs of Japanese Beetle infestation in fruit trees include skeletonized leaves, where the beetles feed on the leaf tissue between the veins, leaving behind a lace-like appearance. You may also notice the presence of adult beetles, which are metallic green with bronze-colored wing covers and are about 1/2 inch long. The beetles tend to congregate in groups on the foliage and fruit of the trees, causing damage to both. In severe infestations, the beetles can completely defoliate the trees, leading to reduced fruit yield and overall tree health. Additionally, you might observe damaged or prematurely ripening fruit with holes or surface feeding caused by the beetles. It's essential to regularly inspect your fruit trees for these signs, especially during the peak activity period of Japanese Beetles, which typically occurs from late June to August, depending on your location.
