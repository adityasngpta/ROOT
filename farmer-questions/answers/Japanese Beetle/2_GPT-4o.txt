Japanese Beetle damage is quite distinctive and can be identified by several key characteristics. These beetles typically skeletonize leaves, meaning they consume the tissue between the veins, leaving a lace-like appearance. This type of damage is most noticeable on plants like roses, grapes, and various fruit trees. Additionally, Japanese Beetles often feed in groups, so you may observe clusters of beetles on affected plants. The beetles themselves are metallic green with copper-brown wing covers, about half an inch long. If you notice these specific signs—skeletonized leaves and the presence of metallic green beetles—it's likely that Japanese Beetles are the culprits. In contrast, other pests may leave different types of damage, such as holes in leaves, chewed edges, or irregular patterns of feeding. Identifying the specific damage pattern and the presence of the beetles will help you confirm if Japanese Beetles are responsible.
