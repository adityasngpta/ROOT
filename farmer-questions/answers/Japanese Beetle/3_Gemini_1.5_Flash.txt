The optimal time to scout for Japanese beetles in ornamental plants is during their adult stage, which typically occurs from late June to early August, depending on your geographic location.  Adult beetles are most active on sunny days with temperatures above 70Â°F. Look for signs of damage, such as ragged leaf margins, skeletonized leaves, and the presence of the beetles themselves, which are metallic green with copper-brown wing covers. It is crucial to scout early in the morning when the beetles are less active and easier to spot. Conduct thorough inspections of the undersides of leaves, as this is where beetles often congregate to feed.  Regular scouting allows you to identify infestations early and implement control measures before significant damage occurs.
