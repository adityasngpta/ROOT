The optimal time to scout for Japanese beetles in ornamental plants is during early summer when they first emerge, typically around late June to early July, depending on your geographic location. These beetles are most active on warm, sunny days, so scouting should be done during these conditions, preferably in the afternoon when they are most active. It's important to continue monitoring throughout the summer as these beetles can feed for several weeks. Early detection is crucial to managing their population effectively, as it allows for timely intervention before they cause significant damage to the plants.
