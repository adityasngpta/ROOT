The optimal time to scout for Japanese Beetles in ornamental plants is typically from late June through August, with peak activity usually occurring in July. It's best to begin scouting efforts in the early morning or late afternoon when the beetles are most active and visible. During these times, the insects tend to congregate on the upper and outer foliage of plants, making them easier to spot. Regular scouting, ideally two to three times per week during this period, will help you detect the onset of an infestation early. Keep in mind that Japanese Beetles are attracted to plants in full sun, so pay extra attention to these areas. By monitoring consistently during this timeframe, you'll be able to implement control measures promptly if needed, potentially preventing significant damage to your ornamental plants.
