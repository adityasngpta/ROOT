Signs of Japanese Beetle infestation in fruit trees include skeletonized leaves, where the tissue between the veins is eaten, leaving a lace-like appearance. You may also notice clusters of beetles feeding on the foliage, flowers, and fruit, often causing significant damage. The beetles are metallic green with copper-brown wing covers and are about half an inch long. Additionally, you might observe reduced fruit quality and yield, as the beetles can damage the fruit directly. Monitoring for these signs early in the growing season can help in managing and mitigating the impact of an infestation.
