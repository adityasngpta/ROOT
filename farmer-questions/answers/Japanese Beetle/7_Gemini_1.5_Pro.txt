Economic thresholds are not typically used for Japanese Beetle control in vineyards. This is because even a small amount of feeding damage to the fruit clusters during the ripening stage can lead to significant economic loss due to reduced fruit quality and potential for fungal infections. Additionally, Japanese Beetles emit aggregation pheromones, attracting more beetles to the vineyard and potentially overwhelming any established threshold. Therefore, focusing on early detection and proactive management strategies like monitoring traps, insecticide netting, and border sprays are more effective than waiting for an economic threshold to be reached. Remember to consult with your local extension office or agricultural advisor for the most accurate and region-specific recommendations.
