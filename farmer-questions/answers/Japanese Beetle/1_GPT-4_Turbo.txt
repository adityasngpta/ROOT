Signs of Japanese beetle infestation in fruit trees include visible damage to the leaves, flowers, and fruits. The beetles are known for their distinctive feeding pattern where they consume the tissue between the veins of the leaves, leaving a skeletonized appearance. This can result in leaves looking lace-like or heavily perforated. Additionally, the beetles, which are metallic blue-green with coppery wing covers, can often be seen feeding in groups, particularly on warm, sunny days. Flowers and ripe fruits may also show signs of feeding damage, appearing chewed and less vigorous. This damage not only reduces the aesthetic and commercial value of the fruit but can also stress the tree and reduce its overall health and productivity. Early detection and management are crucial to minimize the impact of these pests.
