Japanese Beetles thrive in environments with adequate soil moisture, which is essential for the development of their grub stage.  Overwatering or poorly timed irrigation practices, particularly in late summer, can inadvertently create favorable conditions for grub development and increase the subsequent beetle population the following year. Conversely, drought stress can negatively impact grub survival, potentially leading to reduced Japanese Beetle activity. However, relying solely on drought to manage them is not a reliable solution as it can negatively impact your crops.  Therefore, it is crucial to adopt balanced irrigation practices that meet the needs of your crops without inadvertently providing an ideal environment for Japanese Beetle proliferation. This includes using techniques like drip irrigation and avoiding excessive watering.
