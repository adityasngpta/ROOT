Companion planting and trap crops can be valuable tools in managing Japanese Beetle populations.  Companion planting involves strategically placing plants that repel the beetles near susceptible crops, disrupting their feeding and reproduction. For example, planting garlic, chives, or catnip around the perimeter of a garden can deter Japanese Beetles with their strong scents.  Trap crops, on the other hand, involve sacrificing a small area by planting a species highly attractive to the beetles.  This draws the beetles away from the main crop, concentrating them in a manageable location.  Effective trap crops for Japanese Beetles include grapes, Japanese beetle traps baited with pheromones and floral lures. Once the beetles congregate on the trap crop, they can be easily removed and eliminated, reducing their numbers and protecting the primary crop.
