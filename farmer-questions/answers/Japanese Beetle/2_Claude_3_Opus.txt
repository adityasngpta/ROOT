Japanese Beetle damage on plants is quite distinctive and can be differentiated from other pest damage. Adult Japanese Beetles skeletonize the leaves by consuming the soft tissue between the veins, leaving behind a lace-like appearance. This type of feeding damage is usually seen on the upper surface of the foliage. The beetles tend to start feeding from the top of the plant and work their way down, often in large groups, resulting in significant defoliation. In contrast, other leaf-feeding pests, such as caterpillars or sawflies, typically consume entire leaf sections or create irregular holes in the leaves. Japanese Beetle grubs, the larval stage, feed on grass roots, causing patches of dead or dying grass in lawns, which can be mistaken for damage caused by other white grub species. However, the timing of adult beetle activity and the presence of the distinctly skeletonized leaves can help confirm Japanese Beetle infestation.
