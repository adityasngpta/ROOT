Japanese beetle damage is distinctive and can be easily differentiated from other pests.  Adult Japanese beetles primarily feed on foliage, leaving behind a characteristic "skeletonized" appearance. They consume the leaf tissue between the veins, leaving only the veins and a lacy, translucent framework behind. This is in contrast to other pests that may create holes in the leaves or chew along the edges. Additionally, Japanese beetles are attracted to flowers, so you might observe them feeding on flower petals or buds.  For larvae, look for C-shaped grubs in the soil, often found feeding on roots. If you suspect Japanese beetle damage, inspect your plants closely for the characteristic skeletonized leaves and the presence of the adult beetles or larvae. You can further confirm your diagnosis by using traps or monitoring for the characteristic copper-colored beetles with green heads.
