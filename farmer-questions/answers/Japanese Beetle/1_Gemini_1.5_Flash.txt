Japanese beetles are a serious threat to fruit trees, causing significant damage to foliage and fruit.  Recognizing the signs of infestation early is crucial for effective management.  Look for the following: 

* **Skeletonized leaves:**  Beetles feed on the soft tissue between leaf veins, leaving behind a lacey, skeletal framework.
* **Damaged fruit:**  Beetles can damage fruit, leaving behind small, irregular holes and scarring, especially on apples, peaches, and grapes.
* **Adult beetles:** Shiny, metallic green beetles with copper-colored wings are a clear sign of infestation. They are about 1/2 inch long and are active during the day, typically feeding in groups.
* **Grubs in the soil:**  Japanese beetles lay eggs in the soil, and the white grubs that emerge can damage the roots of trees and other plants. Look for signs of soil upheaval or wilting plants. 

Early detection is key. Regular inspection of your trees and immediate action to control the infestation can prevent significant damage.
