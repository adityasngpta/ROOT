Yes, there are plant varieties that exhibit resistance to Japanese beetles, which can be a practical choice for managing these pests in your garden or farm. For example, in the realm of turfgrass, tall fescue and fine fescues are generally less attractive to Japanese beetles compared to Kentucky bluegrass and perennial ryegrass. In terms of ornamental plants, some less preferred options include boxwood, red maple, and magnolia, which tend to be less appealing to these beetles. Incorporating these resistant varieties can help reduce the attractiveness of your landscape to Japanese beetles, thereby naturally lowering their impact. However, it's important to integrate other management strategies as well, such as proper fertilization, watering, and possibly the use of biological controls like milky spore or beneficial nematodes, to effectively control Japanese beetle populations.
