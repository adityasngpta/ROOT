Japanese Beetles are a common pest that can cause significant damage to fruit trees. Some of the key signs of a Japanese Beetle infestation in fruit trees include:

Skeletonized leaves - Japanese Beetles feed on the leaf tissue between the veins, leaving behind a lace-like skeleton of the leaf. This damage can be seen on the leaves of the tree, often starting at the top and outer portions of the canopy.

Defoliation - In severe infestations, Japanese Beetles can strip entire leaves from the tree, leaving the branches bare. This can weaken the tree and impact fruit production.

Damaged fruit - Japanese Beetles will also feed on the fruit itself, creating pits, holes, and other unsightly blemishes that can make the fruit unmarketable. The beetles are attracted to ripe, overripe, or fallen fruit.

Presence of beetles - You may also spot the adult Japanese Beetles themselves feeding on the leaves and fruit. They are metallic green and bronze in color, about 1/2 inch long.

If you notice these signs of Japanese Beetle activity in your fruit trees, it's important to take action quickly to prevent further damage and protect your crop. Implementing an integrated pest management approach, which may include trapping, spraying, or introducing natural predators, can help effectively manage a Japanese Beetle infestation.
