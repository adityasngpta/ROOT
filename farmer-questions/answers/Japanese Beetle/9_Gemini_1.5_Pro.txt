While there aren't any plant varieties completely resistant to Japanese Beetles, some exhibit greater resilience than others.  For instance, Japanese Beetles tend to avoid certain trees like boxwood, red maple, and holly. When it comes to smaller plants, geraniums, zinnias, and lavender are less favored by these pests.  Keep in mind that this is not an exhaustive list, and regional variations in beetle behavior can occur. It's always best to consult with your local agricultural extension office for advice tailored to your specific location and the plants you cultivate.
