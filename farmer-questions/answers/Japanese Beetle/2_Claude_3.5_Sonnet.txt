Japanese Beetle damage is quite distinctive and can be easily identified with a few key characteristics. The most noticeable sign is the skeletonized appearance of leaves, where beetles have eaten the soft tissue between the veins, leaving behind a lace-like network. This damage typically starts at the top of plants and works downward. Unlike some other pests that may create holes or ragged edges, Japanese Beetles consume leaf material in a more uniform pattern. Additionally, they tend to feed in groups, so you'll often see clusters of beetles on affected plants. The adult beetles themselves are also quite recognizable, with a metallic green body and coppery wing covers. They're about 1/2 inch long and oval-shaped. In flowers, Japanese Beetles may eat entire petals, leaving behind ragged blooms. This combination of skeletonized leaves, group feeding behavior, and the presence of the distinctive beetles themselves sets Japanese Beetle damage apart from many other common garden pests.
