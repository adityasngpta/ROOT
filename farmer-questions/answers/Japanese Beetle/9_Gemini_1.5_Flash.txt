While there are no plant varieties completely immune to Japanese beetle infestations, certain plants are considered more resistant than others.  These resistant plants generally have a higher concentration of tannins or other compounds that Japanese beetles find unpalatable. 

For example, some resistant varieties of roses include 'Carefree Beauty' and 'Knock Out', which have shown better tolerance to Japanese beetle damage.  Among vegetables,  'Blue Lake' green beans, 'Purple Majesty' bush beans, and 'Tendercrop' sweet corn have demonstrated higher levels of resistance.  However, even these resistant varieties may still experience some level of damage, especially in areas with high beetle populations. It's essential to remember that insect behavior can vary, and what works in one region may not be effective in another. To further control Japanese beetle populations, consider implementing integrated pest management practices, including cultural controls like handpicking beetles, trapping, and using beneficial insects like parasitic wasps.
