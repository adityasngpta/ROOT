Japanese Beetle infestations in fruit trees can be identified by several distinct signs. The most noticeable indicator is the characteristic feeding damage on leaves, which appears as skeletonized foliage. The beetles consume the soft tissue between leaf veins, leaving behind a lace-like network of veins. This damage typically starts at the top of the tree and progresses downward. You may also observe clusters of adult beetles feeding on fruits, causing surface damage and potentially introducing pathogens. The adult beetles are easily recognizable by their metallic green bodies with coppery wing covers. In addition to visible damage, you might notice a sweet, fruity odor emitted by the beetles to attract others. Infested trees may show signs of stress, such as premature leaf drop or stunted growth. It's important to monitor your fruit trees regularly during the beetles' active season, typically from late spring to mid-summer, to catch infestations early and implement appropriate control measures.
