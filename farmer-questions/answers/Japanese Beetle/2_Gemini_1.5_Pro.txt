Japanese Beetle damage is fairly distinctive and can be identified by examining the pattern of damage on the leaves and by identifying the beetles themselves.  These beetles are attracted to and skeletonize leaves, meaning they eat the tissue between the veins, leaving behind a lace-like appearance.  They also tend to feed in groups, so you may notice heavy damage concentrated in certain areas of your plants.  The beetles themselves are metallic green and copper-brown, about 1/2 inch long, with small white tufts of hair along the sides of their abdomen. While other pests can cause similar damage, the combination of skeletonized leaves and the beetles' unique appearance can help you diagnose the problem.  If you are still uncertain, contact your local agricultural extension office for assistance.
