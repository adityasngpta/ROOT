Japanese beetle damage is quite distinctive compared to other common garden pests. These beetles typically feed on the leaves of a wide range of plants, leaving behind a telltale sign of skeletonized leaves, where only the veins remain. The damage often appears as irregular, lace-like holes in the leaves. In contrast, other pests might cause different types of leaf damage. For example, aphids and spider mites usually cause yellowing or stippling on leaves, while caterpillars might create clean cuts or large holes without leaving the leaf structure skeletonized. Additionally, Japanese beetles are visible during the day and are metallic blue-green with coppery wing covers, which makes them easier to spot and identify on affected plants.
