Scouting for Japanese Beetles in ornamental plants should begin in late spring or early summer, around late May or June.  This is when adult beetles, having just emerged from the soil, start actively feeding and mating.  Early detection is crucial for effective management.  Beetle activity peaks in July but can extend into August, so continue scouting regularly throughout this period. Inspect your plants, especially roses, lindens, and grapes, for signs of beetles or feeding damage. Look for the metallic green and copper-brown beetles on leaves, along with any skeletonized leaves or lace-like patterns, indicating their presence.
