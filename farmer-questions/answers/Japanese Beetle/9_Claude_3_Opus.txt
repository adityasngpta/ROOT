Yes, there are several plant varieties that show resistance to Japanese Beetle infestations. Some of these resistant plants include flowering crabapples, dogwoods, forsythias, hollies, lilacs, magnolias, and pines. Additionally, certain cultivars of roses, such as "Knock Out" and "Flower Carpet," have been bred to be less attractive to Japanese Beetles. 

When selecting plants for your garden or landscape, it's essential to choose varieties that are well-suited to your local climate and soil conditions, as healthy plants are generally more resistant to pest infestations. Incorporating a diverse mix of plants, including those that are less appealing to Japanese Beetles, can help reduce the overall impact of these pests on your garden. 

It's important to note that while these plant varieties show some resistance, they are not entirely immune to Japanese Beetle damage. Monitoring your plants regularly and employing a combination of cultural, biological, and chemical control methods, when necessary, can help manage Japanese Beetle populations and minimize damage to your plants.
