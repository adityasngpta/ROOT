The optimal time to scout for Japanese beetles in ornamental plants is typically during late June to early August, as this is when they emerge from the soil and begin to feed. It's important to start scouting early in this window, particularly in the mornings when the beetles are less active and easier to spot. Regular monitoring during this period will help you identify infestations early, allowing for timely management strategies such as handpicking, using traps, or applying insecticides if necessary. Additionally, keep an eye on weather conditions, as warm, sunny days can increase beetle activity, making them more challenging to control.
