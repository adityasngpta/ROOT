The optimal time to scout for Japanese Beetles in ornamental plants is from mid-June to August, depending on your location. These beetles typically emerge in early summer and can remain active for 4-6 weeks. Start monitoring your plants closely when the first beetles appear, as their population can quickly grow and cause significant damage to foliage, flowers, and fruits. 

Focus your scouting efforts on the upper leaves and flowers of favored host plants like roses, hibiscus, linden, and grape vines. Japanese Beetles are most active during warm, sunny days, so inspect your plants during this time for the best chance of spotting them. If you notice any skeletonized leaves or large numbers of the metallic green beetles, take immediate action to control the infestation and prevent further damage to your ornamental plants.
