Yes, there are certain plant varieties that exhibit resistance to Japanese beetles. For instance, some species of roses, such as 'Knock Out' roses, are known to be less attractive to these pests. Additionally, plants like geraniums, marigolds, and certain types of beans and corn can also show some level of resistance or reduced susceptibility. Incorporating these resistant varieties into your planting strategy can help minimize the impact of Japanese beetles on your crops. However, it's important to note that while resistant varieties can reduce infestations, they may not completely eliminate the problem. Therefore, integrating cultural practices, such as crop rotation and maintaining healthy soil, along with monitoring and using targeted pest control methods, will provide a more comprehensive approach to managing Japanese beetle populations effectively.
