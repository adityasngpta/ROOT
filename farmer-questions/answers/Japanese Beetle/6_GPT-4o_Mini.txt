Yes, biological control agents like nematodes can be effective in managing Japanese beetles. Specifically, entomopathogenic nematodes, such as Heterorhabditis bacteriophora and Steinernema carpocapsae, can target the larvae of Japanese beetles in the soil. When applied to infested areas, these nematodes enter the larvae and release bacteria that kill them, thereby reducing the population of adult beetles that emerge later. For optimal results, it's important to apply nematodes when soil temperatures are between 60°F and 85°F, and to ensure adequate moisture in the soil to facilitate their movement. Integrating nematodes with other pest management strategies, such as cultural practices and monitoring, can enhance overall effectiveness and contribute to sustainable pest management.
