Yes, there are several plant varieties that exhibit some level of resistance against Japanese beetles, a common and destructive agricultural pest. Japanese beetles feed on the leaves, flowers, and fruits of a wide range of plants, causing significant damage to crops and ornamentals. To help farmers manage this pest, plant breeders have developed cultivars with increased resistance or tolerance to Japanese beetle feeding.

Some examples of resistant plant varieties include certain cultivars of roses, linden trees, and crape myrtles. These plants have physical or chemical characteristics that make them less palatable or attractive to Japanese beetles, reducing the extent of damage. Additionally, some varieties of grapes, apples, and other fruit crops have shown improved resistance, which can be beneficial for farmers growing these crops. It's important to note that while these resistant varieties can help, they may not provide complete protection, and integrated pest management strategies, including monitoring, cultural controls, and targeted insecticide applications, may still be necessary to effectively control Japanese beetle infestations.
