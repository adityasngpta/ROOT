Yes, there are several biological control agents that can be effective against Dectes stem borers, which are a common pest in soybean and sunflower crops. One of the most promising options is the use of parasitic wasps, such as Macrocentrus grandii and Cotesia flavipes. These wasps lay their eggs inside the Dectes larvae, and the wasp larvae then feed on and kill the stem borer larvae from the inside. Another potential biological control agent is the entomopathogenic nematode Steinernema carpocapsae, which can infect and kill Dectes larvae in the soil. Additionally, certain predatory insects like ground beetles and spiders can help suppress Dectes populations by feeding on the adult beetles and larvae. Incorporating these natural enemies into an integrated pest management (IPM) program, along with other cultural and mechanical control methods, can be an effective way for farmers to manage Dectes stem borers in a sustainable and environmentally-friendly manner.
