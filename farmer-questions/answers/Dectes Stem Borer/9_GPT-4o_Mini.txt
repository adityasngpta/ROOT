Yes, there are biological control agents available for managing Dectes stem borers, which primarily affect soybean and other crops. One effective approach is the use of parasitic wasps, such as the genus *Tetrastichus*, which can parasitize the larvae of Dectes stem borers. Additionally, entomopathogenic nematodes and fungi can also be employed to target the larvae in the soil. Implementing these biological control agents can help reduce the pest population while minimizing the impact on beneficial insects and the environment. It's important to monitor pest levels and integrate these biological controls with other management practices, such as crop rotation and the use of resistant crop varieties, to achieve effective and sustainable control of Dectes stem borers.
