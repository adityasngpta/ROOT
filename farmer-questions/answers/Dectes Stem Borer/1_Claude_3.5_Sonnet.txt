Dectes Stem Borer infestation in sunflower plants can be identified through several key symptoms. The most noticeable sign is wilting and lodging of mature plants, particularly as harvest approaches. Affected plants may break easily at the soil line or just above it when pushed, due to the larvae tunneling inside the stem and weakening its structure. Upon closer inspection, small entry holes can be observed on the stem's exterior, often accompanied by frass (insect excrement) around these openings. If the stem is split open, you may find the larvae or their tunnels within the pith. Additionally, premature drying of the plant and reduced head size can occur in severely infested plants. As the infestation progresses, yield losses become evident, with some plants potentially dying before seed maturation. It's important for farmers to monitor their sunflower crops regularly, especially during mid to late season, to detect these symptoms early and implement appropriate management strategies.
