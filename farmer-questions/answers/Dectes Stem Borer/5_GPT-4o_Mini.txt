For managing Dectes stem borers, effective chemical control options include the application of insecticides that target the larval stage of the pest. Pyrethroids, such as lambda-cyhalothrin and cyfluthrin, have shown efficacy in controlling Dectes stem borers when applied at the right timing, typically during the early stages of larval development. Additionally, systemic insecticides like chlorantraniliprole can be effective as they are absorbed by the plant and provide longer-lasting protection. It's crucial to monitor the pest population and apply these chemicals at the appropriate growth stages of the crop, ideally when the larvae are actively feeding within the stems. Always follow label instructions for application rates and timing, and consider integrating these chemical controls with cultural practices, such as crop rotation and the removal of infested plant debris, to enhance overall management and reduce the risk of resistance development.
