Unfortunately, there are currently no rescue treatments effective against Dectes Stem Borers once they've infested a crop.  Insecticides are ineffective because the larvae are well-protected inside the plant stems.  This is why preventative measures are essential in managing this pest.  Consult your local extension office for information tailored to your region, as timing is critical for any preventative insecticide applications. They can provide the most up-to-date recommendations for your specific situation.
