No-till farming practices can lead to higher populations of Dectes Stem Borer in soybean fields compared to conventional tillage. In no-till systems, crop residue is left on the soil surface, providing an ideal overwintering habitat for Dectes Stem Borer larvae. The larvae overwinter in soybean stubble and emerge as adults the following growing season, ready to infest the new soybean crop. 

The lack of soil disturbance in no-till fields allows more larvae to successfully survive the winter. In contrast, conventional tillage buries or destroys much of the crop residue, reducing the survival rate of overwintering larvae. Research has shown that Dectes Stem Borer infestations can be 2-3 times higher in no-till soybean fields compared to conventionally tilled fields.

To manage Dectes in no-till soybeans, farmers can use crop rotation to non-host crops like corn or wheat to break the pest's life cycle. Planting soybeans later in the season can also help, as peak adult emergence may occur before the crop is present. Insecticide seed treatments or post-emergence applications can provide some control. However, the best approach is an integrated management strategy combining multiple tactics to reduce Dectes pressure while still realizing the soil health and environmental benefits of no-till farming.
