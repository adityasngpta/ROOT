Dectes Stem Borer infestation in sunflower plants typically presents several distinct symptoms. Initially, you may notice wilting or stunted growth in affected plants, as the larvae bore into the stems, disrupting the plant's vascular system. Look for small holes or entry points on the stem, which can be accompanied by frass (sawdust-like excrement) that accumulates around these openings. As the infestation progresses, the stems may become weakened, leading to lodging or breakage, especially in windy conditions. Additionally, you might observe yellowing leaves or premature leaf drop, which can further indicate stress in the plant. If you suspect an infestation, itâ€™s crucial to monitor your fields closely and consider implementing integrated pest management strategies, such as crop rotation, timely planting, and the use of resistant sunflower varieties to mitigate the impact of Dectes Stem Borer.
