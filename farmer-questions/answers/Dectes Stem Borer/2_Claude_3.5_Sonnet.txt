Distinguishing Dectes Stem Borer larvae from other stem borers can be challenging, but there are a few key characteristics to look for. Dectes larvae are typically creamy white to pale yellow in color, with a slightly darker head capsule. They have a distinctly cylindrical body shape and can grow up to 12-15 mm in length when fully developed. One of the most distinguishing features is the presence of a small, brown, hardened plate on the first segment behind the head, which is unique to Dectes larvae. Additionally, these larvae have very small, almost unnoticeable legs, and their body segments appear somewhat wrinkled or folded. When examining the plant, look for small entry holes near the base of the stem and sawdust-like frass (insect excrement) around these holes, which is characteristic of Dectes Stem Borer activity. If you're still unsure, consider consulting with a local agricultural extension agent or entomologist who can provide a definitive identification and tailored management recommendations for your specific situation.
