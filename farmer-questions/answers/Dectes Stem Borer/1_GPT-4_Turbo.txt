The Dectes Stem Borer infestation in sunflower plants typically manifests through several distinct symptoms. Initially, you might notice wilting in the upper leaves of the plant, which can sometimes be mistaken for drought stress. As the infestation progresses, the entire plant may begin to wilt and exhibit signs of weakness. One of the hallmark symptoms of Dectes Stem Borer infestation is the presence of a small hole near the base of the plant stem, often accompanied by frass (sawdust-like excrement) around the hole. This hole is where the larvae bore into the stem, disrupting the vascular system of the plant. In severe cases, the stem may break at the point of entry, particularly during strong winds or when the plant bears the weight of the developing heads, leading to lodging (falling over) of the plant. Monitoring these symptoms early can help in managing the infestation effectively.
