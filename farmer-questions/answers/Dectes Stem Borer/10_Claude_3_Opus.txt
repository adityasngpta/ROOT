Planting date can have a significant impact on the risk of Dectes Stem Borer infestation in soybeans. Research has shown that earlier planting dates, typically before mid-May, can lead to a higher incidence of Dectes Stem Borer damage. This is because the adult beetles emerge in late June to early July and are attracted to the larger, more mature soybean plants that result from earlier planting. In contrast, later-planted soybeans are generally smaller and less attractive to the adult beetles during their peak emergence period, reducing the likelihood of infestation. Therefore, delaying soybean planting until late May or early June can be an effective strategy to minimize the risk of Dectes Stem Borer damage. However, it's important to balance this with other factors such as yield potential and the risk of other pests or diseases. Farmers should consult with local extension agents or crop advisors to determine the optimal planting date for their specific region and farming operation.
