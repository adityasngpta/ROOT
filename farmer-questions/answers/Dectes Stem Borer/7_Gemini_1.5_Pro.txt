Dectes Stem Borer infestations can significantly impact crop yield, primarily in soybeans and sunflowers. While the initial damage may appear minimal, the larvae's tunneling within the plant weakens its structure.  This internal weakening makes the plant susceptible to lodging, a condition where the stem breaks or bends, particularly under windy conditions.  Lodging can lead to significant yield loss as it hinders the plant's ability to support seed development and makes harvesting difficult and inefficient. Additionally, the entry and exit holes created by the larvae provide entry points for diseases and pathogens, further compromising the plant's health and productivity. The long-term effects are compounded by the pest's lifecycle, as the larvae overwinter in crop residue, leading to potential infestations in subsequent years if proper management strategies are not implemented.
