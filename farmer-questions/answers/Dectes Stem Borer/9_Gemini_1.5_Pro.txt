Unfortunately, there are currently no commercially available biological control agents that specifically target Dectes Stem Borers. While some naturally occurring predators and parasitoids might prey on them, their impact is not significant enough to provide reliable control.  This is why integrated pest management strategies for Dectes Stem Borers often focus on cultural practices like crop rotation, planting date optimization, and selecting resistant varieties when available.  Additionally, destroying crop residue where borers overwinter can help reduce infestations in the following season.
