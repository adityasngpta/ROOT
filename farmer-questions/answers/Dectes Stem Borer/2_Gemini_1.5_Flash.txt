Distinguishing Dectes stem borer larvae from other stem borers can be tricky, as they share similar appearances. However, focusing on key characteristics can help you identify them. Dectes stem borer larvae are typically creamy white to yellowish-white and have a distinct reddish-brown head. They are about 1 inch long when fully grown.  They can be differentiated from other stem borers by their habit of feeding on the pith of the stem, creating tunnels that run lengthwise. These tunnels are filled with frass (insect excrement), which can be seen protruding from the entry holes. You can also look for sawdust-like material around the base of the plant, which indicates the presence of Dectes stem borers. 

Another key distinguishing feature is the larvae's characteristic "S" shaped body when they are disturbed.  Other stem borers may have a different body shape or color pattern. 

To further confirm the identification, you can carefully remove the larvae and observe their head and body shape. You can also consult with a local extension office or pest control professional for assistance in identifying the specific pest.
