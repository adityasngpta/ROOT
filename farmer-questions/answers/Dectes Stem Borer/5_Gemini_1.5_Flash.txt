While chemical control can be effective against Dectes stem borers, it's important to note that an integrated pest management approach, including cultural, biological, and other methods, is generally more sustainable and environmentally friendly. However, if chemical control is deemed necessary,  insecticide options targeting the beetle stage, such as pyrethroids or carbamates, can be used. These chemicals should be applied to the crop canopy where the adult beetles are feeding, typically at dusk when they are most active. Always follow label instructions carefully, including application rates, timing, and safety precautions. Consult with local agricultural extension services for specific recommendations for your region, as the best insecticide choice will depend on factors like crop type, infestation severity, and environmental conditions.  Remember that repeated insecticide use can lead to resistance development, so it's crucial to rotate insecticide classes and use other control measures to minimize reliance on chemicals.
