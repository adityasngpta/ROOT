Dectes stem borers are a major pest of sunflowers, causing significant yield losses. Early detection and management are crucial to minimize their impact. Here are the key symptoms of Dectes stem borer infestation in sunflower plants:

* **Wilting and Stunted Growth:**  The most noticeable symptom is wilting of the sunflower plant, especially during hot, dry periods. This occurs because the larvae feeding inside the stem disrupt the plant's vascular system, hindering water and nutrient transport.
* **Holes and Frass:**  Look for small holes in the stem, often near the base of the plant. These holes are entry points for the larvae, and you may find frass (insect excrement) around the holes or inside the stem.
* **Stem Breakage:** As the larvae mature, they burrow deeper into the stem, weakening its structure. This can lead to stem breakage, especially during windy conditions, resulting in plant lodging.
* **Delayed Flowering:**  Infested plants may experience delayed flowering due to the disruption of nutrient flow. The head may be smaller than normal or may not develop at all.
* **Adults on Plants:**  Adult Dectes stem borers are small, slender beetles with long antennae. They are typically brown or black in color and may be seen on the leaves or stems of sunflower plants.

If you observe any of these symptoms, it's essential to take action promptly to prevent further damage and control the pest population.
