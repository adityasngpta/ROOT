The most effective chemical control options for Dectes Stem Borers (Dectes texanus) are systemic insecticides containing the active ingredients chlorantraniliprole or lambda-cyhalothrin. These insecticides should be applied as foliar sprays during the early stages of soybean pod development, typically when the plants reach the R2-R4 growth stages. Proper timing of the application is crucial to target the adult beetles before they lay eggs and the larvae bore into the stems. It is recommended to consult with local extension services or agricultural professionals to determine the best application rates and timing based on the specific infestation levels and regional conditions. Additionally, always follow the label instructions and safety precautions when using any insecticides to minimize risks to human health and the environment while ensuring effective control of the Dectes Stem Borer population in the soybean fields.
