Distinguishing Dectes Stem Borer larvae from other stem borers involves observing several key characteristics. Dectes Stem Borer larvae are typically creamy white with a cylindrical, segmented body and can grow up to about 1/2 inch in length. They have a distinct brown head capsule and lack legs, which is a notable feature compared to some other stem borer larvae that may have small, rudimentary legs. Additionally, Dectes Stem Borer larvae are known for their behavior of boring into the stems of soybean and sunflower plants, creating tunnels that can weaken the plant structure. If you split open the stem and find larvae along with frass (sawdust-like excrement), it is a strong indicator of Dectes Stem Borer presence. Observing these specific traits and behaviors can help you accurately identify Dectes Stem Borer larvae and differentiate them from other stem borers.
