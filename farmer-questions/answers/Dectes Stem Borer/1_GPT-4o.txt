Dectes Stem Borer infestation in sunflower plants typically manifests through several distinct symptoms. Initially, you may notice wilting or drooping of the upper leaves and stems, which can be mistaken for drought stress. Upon closer inspection, you might find small entry holes at the base of the leaf petioles where the larvae have bored into the stem. As the larvae tunnel through the stem, they weaken the plant's structural integrity, often leading to stem breakage, especially during strong winds or heavy rains. Internally, the stem may appear hollowed out or filled with frass (insect excrement). Additionally, the presence of larvae or pupae within the stem can confirm the infestation. Early detection and management are crucial to prevent significant damage and yield loss.
