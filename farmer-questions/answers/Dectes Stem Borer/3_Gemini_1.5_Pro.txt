Scouting for Dectes Stem Borers in soybean fields should begin in late June to early July. This is when the adult beetles are most active and laying eggs. You'll be looking for the adults at this time, as they are easier to spot than the eggs or larvae. Focus your scouting efforts on field edges, especially near wooded areas, as these are the areas where Dectes Stem Borers are most likely to be found. Continue scouting every 7-10 days until early August to monitor the population and determine if control measures are necessary.
