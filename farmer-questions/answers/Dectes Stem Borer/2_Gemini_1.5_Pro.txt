Dectes Stem Borer larvae can be confused with other stem borers, making accurate identification crucial for effective management.  While many borers have a similar cream-colored, legless grub-like appearance, Dectes Stem Borer larvae possess a distinctive characteristic: a brown, hardened head capsule with noticeable mandibles or mouthparts.  They are typically found tunneling within the pith or central stem of the plant, often leaving behind a sawdust-like frass.  To confirm their presence, carefully split open infested stems lengthwise and look for the characteristic larva and signs of tunneling. Comparing the larvae with images from reputable sources or consulting with your local extension agent can provide a definitive identification and help you make informed decisions about managing this pest.
