The planting date significantly influences the risk of Dectes Stem Borer infestation in crops like soybeans. Early planting tends to result in plants that are more mature and robust by the time the Dectes Stem Borer adults emerge and begin laying eggs. These mature plants are generally less susceptible to severe damage because they can better withstand the larval feeding. Conversely, late-planted crops are often at a higher risk because they are younger and more vulnerable when the borers are most active. The larvae can cause more extensive damage to these less mature plants, leading to greater yield losses. Therefore, adjusting the planting date to ensure crops are more mature during the peak activity period of Dectes Stem Borer can be an effective strategy to mitigate the risk of infestation.
