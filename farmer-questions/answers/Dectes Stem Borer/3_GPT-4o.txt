The best time to scout for Dectes Stem Borers in soybean fields is during the late vegetative to early reproductive stages of the soybean plants, typically from late June through early August. This period coincides with the adult beetles' emergence and egg-laying activities. Regular scouting during this time is crucial as it allows for early detection of the beetles and their larvae, which bore into the stems and can cause significant damage. Look for signs such as adult beetles on the plants, small holes in the stems, and wilting or dying plants. Early detection can help in implementing timely management practices, such as targeted insecticide applications or cultural controls like crop rotation and residue management, to minimize the impact of these pests on your soybean crop.
