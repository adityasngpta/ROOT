Dectes Stem Borer infestation in sunflowers can be tricky to spot early on, as the initial feeding occurs underground. However, as the larvae mature and move upward inside the plant, several telltale signs start to appear.  One of the first things you might notice is wilting of leaves, particularly during the heat of the day. This wilting often progresses, eventually encompassing the entire plant. Upon closer inspection, you might find small, round holes in the lower stem of the sunflower, near the soil line, where the larvae entered. As the larvae tunnel inside the stem, they weaken its structural integrity, making the plants highly susceptible to lodging, especially under windy conditions. In more severe infestations, you may even find the stem completely severed near the base.  Later in the season, you might observe sawdust-like frass, a mixture of excrement and plant material, accumulating around the base of the plant and near entry holes. Keep an eye out for these symptoms throughout the growing season to catch infestations early and implement appropriate management strategies.
