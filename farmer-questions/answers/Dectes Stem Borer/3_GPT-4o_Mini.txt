The best time to scout for Dectes Stem Borers in soybean fields is during the late summer, particularly from mid-July to early September. This is when adult beetles are most active and can be observed laying eggs on the stems of soybean plants. During this period, you should look for signs of damage, such as wilting or lodging of plants, which can indicate the presence of larvae inside the stems. Regular scouting during this time will help you assess the infestation levels and make informed decisions about potential management strategies, such as insecticide applications or cultural practices to minimize damage.
