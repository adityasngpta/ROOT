The Dectes Stem Borer is a significant pest that can cause substantial damage to sunflower plants. The primary symptoms of a Dectes Stem Borer infestation in sunflower plants include wilting, stunted growth, and premature lodging or falling over of the plants. Farmers may notice the plants suddenly wilt and droop, often accompanied by a discoloration of the leaves and stems. The stems may also appear swollen or distorted, and the pith inside the stem may be hollowed out due to the larvae tunneling through the plant. In severe cases, the plants may lodge or fall over prematurely, making it difficult to harvest the crop. Identifying these symptoms early is crucial, as it allows farmers to take prompt action to manage the infestation and minimize yield losses.
