To distinguish Dectes Stem Borer larvae from other stem borers, there are a few key characteristics to look for. Dectes Stem Borer larvae are typically white or cream-colored with a brown head capsule. They have a distinct Y-shaped pattern on the head, which is a distinguishing feature. Additionally, Dectes Stem Borer larvae have a legless, grub-like appearance and can reach up to 1/2 inch in length when fully grown. They primarily feed within the stems of soybeans, sunflowers, and other host plants, creating tunnels and galleries as they move upward. In contrast, other common stem borers, such as the European Corn Borer or Southwestern Corn Borer, have a more caterpillar-like appearance with distinct segmentation and legs. Carefully examining the physical characteristics of the larvae, as well as the host plant and feeding damage, can help you accurately identify Dectes Stem Borer infestations and differentiate them from other stem-boring pests.
