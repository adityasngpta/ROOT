The best time to scout for Dectes stem borers in soybean fields is during the **late vegetative (R1-R2) and early reproductive (R3-R4) stages**. This is when the larvae are actively feeding and tunneling within the stems. Look for wilting plants, especially in the late afternoon, as this can indicate borer activity. Examine the stems at the base of the plant and near the nodes. Look for small, round holes or sawdust-like frass (insect excrement) around the base of the plant. You can also carefully pull back the leaves to expose the stem and look for larvae inside. Scouting should be conducted at least weekly during these stages, and more frequently if you see signs of infestation. It is crucial to monitor the fields closely because infestation can cause significant yield losses.
