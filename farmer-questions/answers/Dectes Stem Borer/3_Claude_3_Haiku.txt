The best time to scout for Dectes Stem Borers in soybean fields is during the late vegetative and early reproductive stages of the crop, typically from late June through August. Dectes Stem Borers are a significant pest of soybeans, and early detection is crucial for effective management. During this period, the larvae of the Dectes Stem Borer are actively feeding within the soybean stems, causing damage that can lead to lodging and reduced yields. By scouting fields regularly, farmers can identify the presence of the pest and take appropriate action to mitigate the impact on their crop. Regular scouting, combined with the implementation of integrated pest management strategies, can help farmers maintain healthy soybean crops and minimize the economic losses associated with Dectes Stem Borer infestations.
