The symptoms of Dectes Stem Borer (Dectes texanus) infestation in sunflower plants can be observed in both the leaves and stems. Initially, the larvae feed on the leaf petioles, causing the leaves to droop or wilt. As the infestation progresses, the larvae tunnel into the main stem of the sunflower plant, weakening its structure. This stem boring activity can lead to lodging, where the plant falls over due to the inability to support its own weight. Inspection of the stem may reveal small, round entry holes and frass (insect excrement) pushed out of these holes. In severe infestations, the plant may exhibit stunted growth and reduced yield. It is important to regularly monitor sunflower fields for these symptoms, especially during the late vegetative and early reproductive stages when the Dectes Stem Borer is most active. Early detection and timely management practices can help minimize the damage caused by this pest.
