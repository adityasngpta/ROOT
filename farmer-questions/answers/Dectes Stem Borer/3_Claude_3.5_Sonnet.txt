The best time to scout for Dectes Stem Borers in soybean fields is typically from late June through early August, with peak activity usually occurring in July. During this period, adult beetles emerge and begin to lay eggs in the soybean plants. It's important to start scouting when soybean plants are in the early reproductive stages, around R1 to R3, as this is when the females are most likely to be depositing eggs in the leaf petioles. Regular field inspections during this time frame will allow farmers to detect the presence of adult beetles and monitor for early signs of infestation, such as wilting or yellowing of upper leaves. By scouting during this critical window, farmers can make timely decisions about management strategies, potentially including the use of insecticides if economic thresholds are reached, to minimize crop damage and yield loss from Dectes Stem Borer infestations.
