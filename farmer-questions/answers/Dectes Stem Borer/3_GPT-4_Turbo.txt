The best time to scout for Dectes Stem Borers in soybean fields is from late June through August. This period aligns with their lifecycle stages when they are most likely to be found in the stems of soybean plants. Early detection is crucial, so begin scouting shortly after flowering occurs in your soybeans. Look for signs of their presence, such as wilting plants and stems with entry holes near leaf petioles. Regular monitoring during this period will help you assess the infestation level and determine the need for control measures to prevent significant yield loss.
