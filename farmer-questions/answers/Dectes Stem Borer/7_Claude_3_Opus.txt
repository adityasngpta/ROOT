The long-term effects of Dectes Stem Borer damage on crop yield can be significant if left unmanaged. These pests bore into the stems of soybean plants, causing tunneling damage that weakens the plant structure. Over time, this damage can lead to lodging, where the stems break and the plants fall over, making harvest difficult and reducing yield. Additionally, the tunneling can disrupt the plant's vascular system, hindering nutrient and water transport, which may stunt growth and reduce pod development. Infested fields may experience yield losses ranging from 10% to 30% or more, depending on the severity of the infestation. Moreover, the presence of Dectes Stem Borer can increase the plant's susceptibility to fungal diseases like stem rot, further compromising plant health and yield potential. Consistent monitoring, timely insecticide applications (if necessary), and the adoption of cultural practices like crop rotation and post-harvest stubble destruction can help minimize the long-term impact of these pests on soybean yields.
