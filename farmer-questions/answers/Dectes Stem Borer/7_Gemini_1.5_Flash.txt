Dectes stem borer infestations can have significant long-term effects on crop yield. The larvae of this pest bore into the stems of various crops, primarily corn and sorghum, causing significant damage that affects plant growth and ultimately reduces yield. The most serious impact is the weakening and eventual lodging of plants, resulting in significant crop loss. The borers' feeding activity can also create entry points for other pathogens and pests, further compromising plant health.  Furthermore, the damage to the stalks can affect the quality of the harvested grain, leading to lower market value.  Long-term, if left unchecked, Dectes stem borer infestations can lead to a decline in soil fertility as the weakened plants cannot effectively contribute to soil health. This can negatively impact future crop yields. Therefore, it is crucial to implement preventative measures and monitor for infestations to mitigate the long-term impact of this pest on crop yield and overall farm sustainability.
