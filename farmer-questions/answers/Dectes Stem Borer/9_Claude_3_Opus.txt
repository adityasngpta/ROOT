Yes, there are a few biological control agents that have shown potential in managing Dectes Stem Borer (Dectes texanus) infestations in soybean and sunflower crops. One promising agent is the parasitic wasp, Zelia tricolor, which is a native species found in the United States. This wasp lays its eggs inside the Dectes Stem Borer larvae, and as the wasp larvae develop, they feed on and kill the host. Research has shown that Z. tricolor can parasitize up to 50% of Dectes Stem Borer larvae in a field, significantly reducing the pest population. Another potential biological control agent is the entomopathogenic fungus, Beauveria bassiana, which infects and kills the Dectes Stem Borer larvae. While these biological control methods have shown promise, they are still being researched and are not yet widely available for commercial use. Farmers should consult with their local extension services or crop advisors to determine the best integrated pest management strategies for their specific situation, which may include a combination of cultural, chemical, and biological control methods.
