The best time to scout for Dectes Stem Borers in soybean fields is during the late reproductive stages of soybean development, typically from late July through August. This is when adult beetles emerge and begin laying eggs in soybean stems. Scouting should focus on field edges near tree lines or areas with giant ragweed, as these are preferred hosts for Dectes Stem Borers before they move into soybeans. Look for signs of infestation such as wilting or lodging plants, and split open stems to check for larvae tunneling inside. Scouting helps assess the level of infestation and determine if management actions are needed. If more than 50% of plants are infested, harvesting early before further lodging occurs can help minimize yield losses. Planning ahead for the next season, such as crop rotation and controlling alternative weed hosts, is important for preventing future infestations.
