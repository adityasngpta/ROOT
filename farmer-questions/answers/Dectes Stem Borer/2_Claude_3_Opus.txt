To distinguish Dectes Stem Borer larvae from other stem borers, you should look for specific identifying characteristics. Dectes Stem Borer larvae are cream-colored with a brown head capsule and can grow up to half an inch long. They create tunnels within the stems of soybean plants, often causing the plants to lodge or break off. A key distinguishing feature is the presence of a single larva per stem, as opposed to multiple larvae that may be found with other stem borers. Additionally, Dectes Stem Borer damage typically occurs later in the growing season, from late July through August, whereas other stem borers may infest plants earlier. Closely examining the larvae, noting the time of infestation, and checking for the presence of a single larva per stem can help you accurately identify Dectes Stem Borer larvae and differentiate them from other stem-boring pests.
