Distinguishing Dectes Stem Borer larvae from other stem borers involves observing a few key characteristics. Dectes Stem Borer larvae are typically about 1/2 inch long and have a distinct, pale gray to white body with a darker head. Unlike some other stem borers, Dectes larvae have a unique feature: a dark, hardened plate (sclerotized) on the segment just behind the head. Additionally, they are known for their behavior of tunneling into the stems of plants, particularly soybeans, and can often be found near the base of the plant, where they create a characteristic girdling pattern as they prepare to overwinter. This girdling can cause the plant to break at the weakened point. Observing these physical features and behaviors can help accurately identify the Dectes Stem Borer larvae in your crops.
