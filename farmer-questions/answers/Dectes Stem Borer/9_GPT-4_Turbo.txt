Currently, there are no widely established biological control agents specifically for managing Dectes stem borer in soybeans or other crops. However, general biological control practices can be part of an integrated pest management (IPM) strategy. These include promoting natural enemies such as parasitoid wasps, predatory beetles, and spiders that may naturally occur in your fields and can help suppress the borer population. Additionally, cultural practices such as crop rotation, timely planting, and destruction of crop residues can significantly reduce the impact of Dectes stem borer by disrupting their life cycle. Research into specific biological controls for Dectes stem borer is ongoing, so keeping up with the latest agricultural research and extension recommendations is advisable.
