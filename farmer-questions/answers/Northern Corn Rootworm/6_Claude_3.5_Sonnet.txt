For Northern Corn Rootworm control, economic thresholds can vary depending on factors such as corn growth stage, expected yield, and market prices. Generally, a common threshold is when you observe an average of 0.75 to 1 adult rootworm beetle per plant during silk stage. This level of infestation typically indicates that larval populations in the following season may be high enough to cause economic damage. However, it's important to note that thresholds can be lower in continuous corn fields or areas with a history of rootworm problems. For a more precise assessment, consider using sticky traps to monitor beetle populations, with a threshold of about 2-4 beetles per trap per day over a week-long period. Additionally, scouting for root damage during the growing season can help inform control decisions, with a Node Injury Scale score of 0.25 or higher often warranting treatment. Always consult with your local extension office for region-specific recommendations, as thresholds may need to be adjusted based on local conditions and management practices.
