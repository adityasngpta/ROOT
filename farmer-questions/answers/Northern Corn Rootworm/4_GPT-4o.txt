Bt corn hybrids, which are genetically engineered to express Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) proteins, have been quite effective in managing Northern Corn Rootworms (NCR). These hybrids produce specific Bt toxins that target and kill rootworm larvae when they feed on the corn roots, significantly reducing root damage and improving plant health and yield. However, the effectiveness can vary depending on the specific Bt trait used and the local rootworm population's susceptibility. Over time, some rootworm populations have developed resistance to certain Bt proteins, which underscores the importance of integrated pest management (IPM) strategies. These strategies include crop rotation, using multiple Bt traits, and incorporating non-Bt corn with soil insecticides to delay resistance development and maintain the effectiveness of Bt corn hybrids.
