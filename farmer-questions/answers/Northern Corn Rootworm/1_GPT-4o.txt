Early signs of Northern Corn Rootworm infestation in corn fields include the presence of adult beetles on the corn plants, particularly during the late summer months. These beetles are typically yellow-green with black stripes or spots. You may also notice feeding damage on the leaves, silks, and pollen, which can affect pollination and kernel development. Another critical sign is root damage, which can be observed by digging up plants and examining the roots for pruning or tunneling. Severely damaged roots may cause the plants to lodge, or fall over, making them more susceptible to further damage and reducing overall yield. Monitoring these signs early can help in taking timely action to manage the infestation effectively.
