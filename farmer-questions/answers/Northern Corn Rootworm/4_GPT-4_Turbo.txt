Bt corn hybrids, which are genetically modified to express Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) toxins, are generally effective against Northern Corn Rootworms. These hybrids produce specific proteins that target the digestive systems of the rootworm larvae, leading to their death. However, the effectiveness can vary based on the specific Bt trait used in the corn hybrid. Some traits are more effective against Northern Corn Rootworms than others. It's important to note that resistance management is crucial, as there have been increasing reports of resistance development in rootworm populations. Farmers should use Bt corn as part of an integrated pest management (IPM) strategy, including crop rotation and the use of non-Bt corn, to help mitigate resistance development and maintain the effectiveness of Bt technology.
