Early signs of Northern Corn Rootworm (NCR) infestation in corn fields include visible adult beetles feeding on corn silks and leaves during late summer. These beetles are typically yellow to green in color and about 1/4 inch long. Larval damage to the roots becomes apparent when corn plants exhibit signs of nutrient deficiencies, stunted growth, and a tendency to lodge or fall over due to weakened root systems. This lodging is especially noticeable after strong winds or heavy rains. Closer inspection of the roots may reveal chewing damage and the presence of white, slender larvae. Heavy infestations can lead to significant yield losses if left unmanaged. Regularly scouting fields, particularly those with a history of NCR problems or continuous corn production, is crucial for early detection and timely implementation of control measures.
