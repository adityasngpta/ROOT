When it comes to managing Northern Corn Rootworm (NCR) infestations, establishing appropriate economic thresholds is crucial for making informed and cost-effective control decisions. The economic threshold for NCR is the pest population level at which the cost of control measures is justified by the expected yield loss prevention. 

For NCR, the recommended economic threshold is an average of 0.75 to 1 adult beetle per plant during the silking to blister stages of corn development. This threshold is based on research showing that at this population level, the yield loss caused by root feeding can outweigh the costs of implementing control strategies, such as insecticide applications or crop rotation. 

It's important to note that the economic threshold can vary depending on factors like corn prices, control costs, and expected yield. Regularly monitoring NCR populations throughout the growing season and comparing the observed levels to the economic threshold can help farmers determine the most appropriate time to implement control measures. By using this economic threshold, farmers can optimize their pest management strategies, minimize unnecessary costs, and maintain sustainable corn production.
