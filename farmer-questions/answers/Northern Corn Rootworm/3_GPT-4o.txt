The best time to scout for Northern Corn Rootworms in your fields is during the late spring to early summer, specifically from late June through early August. This period coincides with the peak activity of adult rootworms, making it easier to detect their presence. Scouting should be done regularly, at least once a week, to monitor the population levels accurately. Pay close attention to the base of corn plants and the soil around the roots, as this is where larvae feed and cause the most damage. Additionally, inspecting the leaves and silks for adult beetles can help you assess the potential for future infestations. Early detection is crucial for implementing timely and effective management strategies to minimize crop damage and yield loss.
