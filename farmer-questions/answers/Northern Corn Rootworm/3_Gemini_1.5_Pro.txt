Scouting for Northern Corn Rootworm adults is best done during the weeks of silking and tasseling in corn.  This is typically from late June to early August, but the exact timing can vary depending on your location and the specific year's weather conditions. During these weeks, the adult beetles emerge and feed on corn silks, potentially interfering with pollination.  By scouting during this peak activity period, you can accurately assess the adult population and determine if their numbers warrant management intervention to protect your crop yield.
