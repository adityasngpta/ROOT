Northern Corn Rootworm (NCR) damage can be differentiated from other pests primarily by examining the roots of corn plants. NCR larvae feed on the roots, causing distinctive pruning and tunneling damage. This often results in the roots appearing brown and scaly, with visible feeding scars. In severe cases, the root damage can lead to "goose necking," where the plant roots are so damaged that the corn stalks lean or fall over, a phenomenon also known as lodging. In contrast, other common pests like corn borers typically damage the stalks and leaves rather than the roots, and their presence can be confirmed by finding holes and tunnels within the stalks. Additionally, rootworm damage is usually concentrated below the soil surface on the roots, whereas other pests might affect above-ground parts more visibly. To confirm the presence of NCR, you can dig up a few plants and wash the roots to look for the small, white larvae or evidence of their feeding. This differentiation is crucial for applying the correct management strategies, such as crop rotation, use of Bt corn varieties, or soil-applied insecticides specifically targeting rootworms.
