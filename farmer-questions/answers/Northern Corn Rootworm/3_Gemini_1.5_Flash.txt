The best time to scout for Northern Corn Rootworms in your fields is during the **V4-V6 corn growth stage**, which is when the corn plant has 4-6 visible leaves. At this stage, the corn rootworm beetles are actively feeding and mating, making them easier to detect. This is also the critical time to assess the potential for damage to your corn roots. Focus your scouting efforts on the **edges of the field**, as this is where the beetles are most likely to be concentrated. Look for signs of **feeding damage** on the leaves, such as small, circular holes or skeletonized leaves. Also, carefully **examine the base of the plant** to look for signs of rootworm larvae feeding. You may need to gently pull up the plant to check for root damage. If you find evidence of rootworm activity, you can then decide if insecticide application is necessary based on the severity of the infestation and the economic threshold for your region.
