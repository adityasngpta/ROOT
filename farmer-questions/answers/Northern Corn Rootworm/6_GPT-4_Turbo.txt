The economic threshold for Northern Corn Rootworm (NCR) largely depends on several factors including the cost of control measures, the price of corn, and the expected yield loss due to rootworm damage. Generally, an economic threshold can be considered when there are about 0.5 to 0.75 beetles per plant during the peak beetle activity period in late July to early August. This threshold indicates when the potential yield loss from rootworm damage exceeds the cost of control measures. It's important to monitor beetle populations closely using yellow sticky traps or direct plant inspections to make timely and effective management decisions. Additionally, consider integrating cultural practices such as crop rotation and the use of resistant corn varieties along with chemical controls to manage NCR effectively and sustainably.
