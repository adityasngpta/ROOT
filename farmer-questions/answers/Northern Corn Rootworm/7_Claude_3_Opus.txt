Crop rotation can have a significant impact on managing Northern Corn Rootworm (NCR) populations in agricultural fields. NCR larvae primarily feed on corn roots, and adult beetles lay their eggs in corn fields during late summer. When the same field is planted with corn the following year, the larvae emerge and infest the new corn crop. By rotating corn with other crops such as soybeans, alfalfa, or small grains in alternating years, the cycle of NCR infestation can be disrupted. NCR larvae that hatch in a field planted with a non-host crop will not survive, effectively reducing the population. However, some NCR populations have adapted to crop rotation by extending their egg diapause, allowing eggs to remain dormant in the soil for two or more years until corn is planted again. Therefore, crop rotation remains an important tool in NCR management but should be combined with other integrated pest management strategies, such as planting resistant corn hybrids, using soil insecticides when necessary, and monitoring beetle populations to make informed decisions.
