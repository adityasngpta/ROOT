The best time to scout for Northern Corn Rootworms is during the early to mid-summer, specifically from late June to early July. This period coincides with the peak egg hatch and larval activity, making it crucial for identifying potential infestations. During this time, you should inspect the root systems of your corn plants, looking for signs of feeding damage, such as root pruning or the presence of larvae. Additionally, monitoring adult beetle populations can also be beneficial, as they typically emerge around the same time. Regular scouting during this window will help you make informed decisions about pest management strategies, such as the need for insecticides or crop rotation, to mitigate the impact of these pests on your corn yield.
