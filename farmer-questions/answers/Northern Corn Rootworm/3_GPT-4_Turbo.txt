The best time to scout for Northern Corn Rootworms in your fields is during the late spring and early summer, specifically around late June to early July. This timing is crucial as it coincides with the egg hatch and early larval stages, when the rootworms begin feeding on corn roots. Scouting during this period allows you to assess the infestation levels before the larvae cause significant root damage. Look for signs of feeding damage on the roots and the presence of small, white larvae. Effective scouting during this period can help you decide if and when a control strategy should be implemented to manage the rootworm population effectively.
