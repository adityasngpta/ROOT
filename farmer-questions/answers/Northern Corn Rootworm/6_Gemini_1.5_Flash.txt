Determining the economic threshold for Northern Corn Rootworm control requires considering various factors, including your specific field history, corn variety, and anticipated corn prices.  Generally, the economic threshold is the point at which the cost of controlling the pest is equal to the potential yield loss if left untreated. For Northern Corn Rootworm, this typically ranges from 1 to 3 beetles per plant at silking.  However, factors like soil type, previous rotations, and insecticide resistance levels can influence this threshold.  

For example, if you have a history of severe rootworm infestations, or if you are planting a susceptible corn variety, you may want to lower your economic threshold to 1 beetle per plant. Conversely, if you have a history of low rootworm pressure or are planting a resistant corn variety, you may be able to tolerate up to 3 beetles per plant. 

It's crucial to regularly monitor your fields for rootworm activity using traps or scouting techniques.  You can consult with your local Extension office or pest control advisor for guidance on setting the appropriate economic threshold for your specific situation. By carefully considering all relevant factors, you can make informed decisions about when to intervene and manage your rootworm population effectively, while minimizing the environmental impact and economic losses associated with insecticide use.
