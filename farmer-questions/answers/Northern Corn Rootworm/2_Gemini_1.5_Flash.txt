Northern corn rootworm (NCR) damage is often confused with other pests, but there are key differences.  NCR larvae primarily feed on roots, causing stunted growth and wilting, especially during hot, dry periods. You'll often see the plant easily pulled from the ground. Look for "dead hearts," which are wilting plants with no central stalk, and "bare stalks" where the plant has broken off at the root.  Check the roots for characteristic "shredding" or feeding damage.  Compare these signs to other potential pests like Western corn rootworm (WCR), which can cause similar damage but often leaves a "C" shaped tunnel on the root.  If you see a large number of beetles on the silks of your corn plants, this could be an indicator of adult WCR.  However, if you see larvae inside the stalk, it is likely a European corn borer, which can also cause wilting and lodging.  Always consult a pest identification guide or your local extension service to be sure of your diagnosis.
