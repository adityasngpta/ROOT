Economic thresholds are not typically used for Northern Corn Rootworm (NCR) control. This is because NCR damage can be highly variable and difficult to assess early on, and by the time visible damage appears, it's often too late for effective control. Additionally, even small numbers of NCR larvae can cause significant root damage, leading to lodging and yield loss, especially under drought conditions.  Therefore, preventative management strategies are generally recommended for NCR. These strategies include crop rotation, planting Bt corn hybrids with efficacy against NCR, and, if necessary, applying a soil insecticide at planting.  Consult your local extension service or agricultural advisor for region-specific recommendations.
