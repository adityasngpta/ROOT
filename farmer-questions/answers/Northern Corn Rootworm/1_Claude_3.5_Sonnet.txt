Early signs of Northern Corn Rootworm infestation in corn fields can be subtle and easily overlooked, but vigilant farmers can spot them with careful observation. One of the first indicators is the presence of adult beetles on corn silks and leaves, typically appearing in late July to early August. These small, pale green beetles may not cause significant damage themselves, but their presence signals potential larval activity below ground. Another early sign is the "goose-necking" or lodging of corn plants, where they appear bent or leaning due to compromised root systems. This occurs because the larvae feed on corn roots, weakening the plant's ability to stand upright. Farmers may also notice patches of stunted or yellowing corn plants, as the root damage can impair nutrient uptake. Additionally, if you dig up affected plants and examine the roots, you may find pruned or tunneled roots, which is a clear indication of rootworm feeding. It's important to monitor fields regularly and consider implementing a scouting program to catch these early signs before the infestation becomes severe and impacts yield significantly.
