Early signs of Northern Corn Rootworm infestation in corn fields primarily include wilting, stunted growth, and yellowing of plants, which may not be immediately apparent. These symptoms occur because the larvae feed on the roots, impairing the plant's ability to absorb water and nutrients. As the damage progresses, affected corn plants may show more pronounced symptoms such as "goose-necking," where the stem bends toward the ground due to root damage. Additionally, you might observe root pruning and smaller root masses upon closer inspection of the roots. Scouting for these signs early in the season, particularly as larvae begin to hatch and feed, is crucial for managing and mitigating the impact of these pests effectively.
