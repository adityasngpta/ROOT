The best time to scout for Northern Corn Rootworms (NCR) in your fields is during the late vegetative and reproductive stages of the corn crop, typically from late June through August. This is when the adult beetles emerge and begin feeding on corn leaves and silks, and when the larvae are actively feeding on the corn roots. Scouting during this period allows you to assess the level of infestation and determine if any management actions are necessary. When scouting, focus on examining the root systems of your corn plants, looking for signs of larval feeding, such as root pruning or lodging. Additionally, observe the presence and abundance of adult beetles on the leaves and silks, as this can indicate the potential for future larval infestations. Monitoring the population levels and timing of NCR activity will help you make informed decisions about the need for control measures, such as crop rotation, the use of insecticides, or the implementation of other integrated pest management strategies.
