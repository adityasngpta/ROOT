While there are no single "best" natural predators that completely control Northern Corn Rootworms (NCR), several beneficial insects and organisms play a role in suppressing their populations. Here's a breakdown:

**Beneficial Nematodes:**  These microscopic roundworms are highly effective against NCR larvae. Species like *Heterorhabditis bacteriophora* and *Steinernema carpocapsae* infect and kill the larvae, providing biological control. You can purchase and apply these nematodes directly to your soil during planting.

**Predatory Insects:** Certain insects like ground beetles, rove beetles, and soldier beetles can prey on NCR larvae and eggs. Encouraging biodiversity by creating habitat for these beneficial insects through conservation tillage, planting cover crops, and reducing insecticide use can promote their presence.

**Parasitoids:** Several wasp species, such as *Cotesia flavipes* and *Habrobracon hebetor*, are parasitoids that lay their eggs inside NCR larvae, killing them from within. Promoting these wasps by providing flowering plants and other food sources can enhance their populations.

**Other Factors:**  While not directly predatory, natural enemies like birds, spiders, and other insects can contribute to NCR control by preying on larvae and eggs. 

However, it's important to note that relying solely on natural predators may not be enough for complete control, especially in areas with high NCR populations. Integrating other control methods, such as crop rotation, resistant varieties, and targeted insecticide applications when necessary, can provide a more effective and sustainable management strategy.
