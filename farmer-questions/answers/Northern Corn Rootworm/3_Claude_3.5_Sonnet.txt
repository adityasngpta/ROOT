The best time to scout for Northern Corn Rootworms in your fields is typically during late July to early August. This period coincides with the peak emergence of adult beetles, making them easier to spot and assess population levels. Adult Northern Corn Rootworms are small, pale green beetles that feed on corn silks and pollen. To effectively scout, walk through your cornfields in a zigzag pattern, examining plants for the presence of these beetles on the leaves, tassels, and especially the silks. Pay close attention to field edges and areas with a history of rootworm problems. It's also important to check for root damage by digging up plants and examining the root systems for pruning or tunneling, which can indicate larval feeding earlier in the season. Remember that scouting at this time will help you make informed decisions about management strategies for the following growing season, as the eggs laid by these adults will hatch into larvae that can damage next year's crop.
