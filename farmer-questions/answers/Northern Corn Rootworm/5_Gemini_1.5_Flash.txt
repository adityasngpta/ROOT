Several cultural practices can help reduce Northern Corn Rootworm (NCR) populations in your fields. One effective approach is crop rotation.  Rotating corn with non-host crops like soybeans, alfalfa, or small grains disrupts the NCR's life cycle, as the beetles cannot survive in these alternative crops. This practice prevents the build-up of NCR populations in your fields. Another crucial practice is planting corn hybrids with good rootworm resistance. These hybrids have genetically encoded traits that make them less susceptible to rootworm damage, leading to better plant health and yield.  Planting corn in a timely manner can also help reduce NCR populations. Early planting allows corn plants to develop a stronger root system, increasing their resilience against rootworm damage.  Furthermore, utilizing a delayed planting date for corn can disrupt the NCR life cycle and reduce populations. This is because the beetles emerge from the soil in early summer, and delaying planting allows the adults to lay eggs in fields that will not be planted with corn, reducing the number of larvae in your field. Lastly, controlling weeds can help reduce NCR populations. Weeds can provide shelter and resources for the beetles, so keeping your fields clean will help disrupt their life cycle and reduce their numbers.  Implementing these cultural practices in combination will provide a comprehensive approach to manage Northern Corn Rootworm populations and maintain healthy, productive corn crops.
