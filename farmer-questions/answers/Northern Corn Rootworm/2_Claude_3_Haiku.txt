To differentiate Northern Corn Rootworm (NCR) damage from other pests, there are a few key signs to look for. First, examine the corn plant's root system. NCR larvae feed on the roots, causing them to appear pruned or stubby, with a characteristic 'goose-necking' appearance where the plant's stem bends over. This root damage can lead to lodging, where the plant falls over, as well as reduced nutrient and water uptake, resulting in stunted growth and lower yields. In contrast, other pests like wireworms or white grubs may cause more generalized root damage without the distinctive goose-necking. Additionally, look for the presence of NCR adult beetles, which are yellow-green in color with black stripes on their wing covers. Their feeding on corn leaves can also cause characteristic 'window-pane' damage. By closely inspecting the roots and looking for the characteristic signs of NCR infestation, you can differentiate this pest from other issues affecting your corn crop and take appropriate management actions.
