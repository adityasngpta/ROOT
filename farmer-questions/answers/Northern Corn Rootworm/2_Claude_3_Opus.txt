To differentiate Northern Corn Rootworm (NCR) damage from other pests, you should look for specific signs and symptoms. NCR larvae feed on corn roots, causing the plants to become stunted, weak, and prone to lodging (falling over). The root damage will be characterized by pruning and tunneling, with the presence of brown, elongated larvae in the soil around the roots. Adult NCR beetles can also cause damage to corn silks and leaves, resulting in reduced pollination and ear fill. Other pests, such as wireworms or white grubs, may cause similar root damage, but they have different larval appearances and do not typically cause the extensive silk and leaf damage associated with adult NCR feeding. If you suspect NCR infestation, dig up some affected plants and examine the roots for the presence of larvae and the characteristic root pruning. Confirming the pest's identity will help you choose the most appropriate management strategies, such as crop rotation, insecticide treatments, or the use of NCR-resistant corn hybrids.
