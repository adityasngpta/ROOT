The economic threshold for Northern Corn Rootworm (NCR) control is typically based on the density of adult beetles observed in the field, as well as the potential for root damage in the following growing season. For most regions, the threshold is generally set at an average of 0.75 to 1 adult beetle per plant during the peak beetle emergence period, which usually occurs in late July to early August. If beetle counts exceed this threshold, it indicates a high likelihood of significant root damage the next year, warranting control measures. These measures can include crop rotation, as NCR larvae primarily feed on corn roots, or the use of insecticide-treated seeds and soil-applied insecticides. Monitoring should be done regularly using yellow sticky traps or visual inspections to ensure accurate assessment. Implementing these thresholds helps in making informed decisions that balance pest control costs with potential yield losses, promoting sustainable and economically viable farming practices.
