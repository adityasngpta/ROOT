Bt corn hybrids, which are genetically modified to produce insecticidal proteins derived from the bacterium Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt), have been shown to be highly effective against the Northern Corn Rootworm (NCR). Numerous studies have demonstrated that Bt corn hybrids expressing Cry3Bb1, mCry3A, or eCry3.1Ab proteins can provide excellent control of NCR larvae, reducing root damage and larval populations by 90% or more compared to non-Bt corn. This high level of protection is due to the Bt toxins being expressed throughout the plant, including the roots, which effectively target and kill the NCR larvae as they feed. The use of Bt corn has become a widely adopted and effective management strategy for controlling this major corn pest, helping to minimize yield losses and reduce the need for insecticide applications. However, it is important to note that the continued efficacy of Bt corn against NCR relies on implementing resistance management practices, such as rotating to non-Bt corn or using pyramided Bt traits, to prevent the development of resistance in the pest population.
