The best time to scout for Northern Corn Rootworms is during the silk stage of corn development, which typically occurs in July and August. This is when adult beetles emerge from the soil and begin feeding on corn silks, which can interfere with pollination and lead to reduced kernel set. Scouting should be done weekly during this period, particularly in fields with a history of rootworm damage or continuous corn production.

When scouting, examine the ear zone and silks for the presence of adult beetles. If you find an average of 0.75 to 1 beetle per plant, this indicates a potentially damaging population that may require management. Additionally, you can assess root damage from rootworm larvae by digging up and examining the roots of several plants in different areas of the field. A rating of 0.25 (1/4 of a node eaten) or higher suggests a potentially yield-reducing infestation.

By regularly monitoring your fields during the silk stage, you can detect Northern Corn Rootworm populations early and make informed decisions about the need for management strategies, such as crop rotation, insecticide treatments, or the use of rootworm-resistant corn hybrids in future growing seasons.
