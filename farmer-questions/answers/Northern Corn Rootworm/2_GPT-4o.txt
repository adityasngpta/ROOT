Differentiating Northern Corn Rootworm damage from other pests involves closely examining the symptoms and signs on your corn plants. Northern Corn Rootworm larvae primarily target the roots, causing root pruning, which can lead to lodging where the plants fall over due to weakened root systems. You may notice roots that appear chewed or pruned, and in severe cases, the plants may exhibit "goosenecking," where the stalks curve as they attempt to grow upright after falling. Adult Northern Corn Rootworms are small, greenish-yellow beetles that feed on corn silks and leaves, creating a lace-like appearance on the foliage. In contrast, other pests like the Western Corn Rootworm may cause similar root damage but can be distinguished by the adult beetles' different colorationâ€”yellow with black stripes. Additionally, pests like the European Corn Borer or Corn Earworm target different parts of the plant, such as the stalks and ears, rather than the roots. Monitoring for the presence of larvae in the soil and adult beetles on the plants, along with the specific damage patterns, will help you accurately identify Northern Corn Rootworm infestations.
