Yes, cover crops can be a valuable tool in managing Northern Corn Rootworm (NCR) infestations.  Cover crops, particularly those with strong root systems like hairy vetch, rye, and clover, can help disrupt the lifecycle of NCR beetles. By providing a dense, competing root system, cover crops can make it harder for NCR larvae to access corn roots. Additionally, some cover crops, like hairy vetch, can release nitrogen into the soil, promoting corn growth and potentially increasing resistance to rootworm damage. However, the effectiveness of cover crops in NCR management depends on several factors including cover crop species, planting timing, and soil type. It's important to research and consult with local experts to determine the best cover crop strategy for your specific conditions.
