Weather conditions significantly influence the activity and damage caused by Northern Corn Rootworm (NCR). Warm and dry conditions during the growing season tend to increase NCR activity, as these pests thrive in such environments. High temperatures accelerate their life cycle, leading to earlier and potentially more severe infestations. Conversely, wet and cool conditions can suppress their activity and reduce their population growth. Excessive rainfall can drown larvae in the soil, while cooler temperatures slow their development. Additionally, drought-stressed corn plants are more vulnerable to rootworm damage because their root systems are already compromised, making it easier for larvae to cause significant harm. Therefore, monitoring weather patterns and adjusting pest management strategies accordingly is crucial for mitigating NCR damage.
