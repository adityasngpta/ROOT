Early signs of Northern Corn Rootworm infestation in corn fields include the presence of small, irregular holes in the leaves, particularly on the lower leaves, which can indicate feeding damage. Additionally, you may notice yellowing or wilting of plants, especially during dry conditions, as the root damage affects the plant's ability to uptake water and nutrients. Another critical sign is the presence of larvae in the soil, which can be identified by digging around the root zone and looking for small, white, C-shaped larvae. Furthermore, if you observe plants that are stunted or leaning, this could be a result of root damage caused by the larvae feeding on the root system. Monitoring these signs early can help you implement control measures before the infestation escalates.
