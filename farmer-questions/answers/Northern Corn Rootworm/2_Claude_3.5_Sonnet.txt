Northern Corn Rootworm damage can be distinguished from other pest damage through careful observation of specific symptoms. The most characteristic sign is root pruning, where the larvae feed on corn roots, causing them to appear stubby or "pruned." This damage weakens the plant's ability to absorb water and nutrients, leading to lodging or "goosenecking" of corn stalks, especially during windy conditions. Above ground, you may notice stunted growth, wilting, or yellowing of leaves, particularly during dry periods. Unlike some other pests, Northern Corn Rootworm damage is typically concentrated in patches rather than uniformly across a field. Adult beetles may also be visible feeding on corn silks and pollen, causing silk clipping which can interfere with pollination. To confirm the presence of Northern Corn Rootworm, you can dig up affected plants and look for small, white larvae in the root zone or conduct root ratings to assess the extent of damage. It's important to note that these symptoms can be similar to those caused by Western Corn Rootworm, so additional identification of adult beetles may be necessary for a definitive diagnosis.
