Northern corn rootworm larvae can inflict significant damage to corn crops, and distinguishing their feeding patterns from other soil-dwelling pests is vital for effective management.  Look for these signs to identify Northern Corn Rootworm damage: The larvae primarily target the roots, chewing on them and creating characteristic brown, gouged-out areas.  As the infestation progresses, the roots may become severely pruned and weakened, leading to stunted growth, lodging (leaning or falling over) in corn stalks, and reduced yield.  You may also observe goosenecking, where the plant bends sharply from the base due to weakened root support.  Additionally, keep an eye out for adult rootworms feeding on corn silks, which can interfere with pollination and further impact yield.  Remember that various soilborne pests can cause similar damage, so if you are unsure, it is always best to consult with your local extension service or an agricultural expert for accurate identification and control recommendations.
