For Northern Corn Rootworm control, the economic threshold typically recommended is around 5 to 7 larvae per plant at the time of planting or shortly after emergence. This threshold can vary based on factors such as the value of the crop, the cost of control measures, and the expected yield loss. If you find that the larval population exceeds this threshold, it may be economically viable to implement control measures, such as insecticides or crop rotation strategies. Additionally, monitoring for adult beetles later in the season can help inform future management decisions, as high adult populations can indicate potential issues for the following year. Always consider integrating cultural practices and resistant hybrids to enhance your overall pest management strategy.
