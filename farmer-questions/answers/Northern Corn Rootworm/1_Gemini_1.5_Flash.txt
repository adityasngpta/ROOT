Identifying Northern Corn Rootworm (NCR) infestation early is crucial for effective management. While adults are easy to spot on corn silks, their feeding damage is minimal. The real damage occurs underground, caused by the larvae. Early signs include wilting, stunted growth, and uneven plant heights within the field. Look for plants that easily pull up from the soil, indicating damaged root systems. Another sign is the presence of small, round holes in the roots, which are entry points for the larvae. Carefully examine the roots for a whitish, C-shaped grub, the larval stage of NCR. These larvae feed on the roots, reducing nutrient and water uptake, ultimately impacting plant growth and yield. If you suspect NCR infestation, consider soil sampling to confirm the presence of larvae and determine the severity of the infestation. Early detection allows for timely intervention with appropriate control measures, minimizing the impact on your crop yield.
