Northern Corn Rootworm infestations can be identified in cornfields by carefully observing the crop for several telltale signs.  One of the earliest signs is the appearance of small, elongated holes in the leaves, often referred to as "shotgun" holes because of their resemblance to shotgun blasts.  These holes occur as adult beetles feed on the corn leaves before laying eggs. While this feeding damage is generally minimal and does not significantly impact yield, it signals the presence of egg-laying adults and a potential larval infestation in the soil for the following year.  Farmers should be particularly vigilant if their fields have a history of corn rootworm problems or if neighboring fields show these signs.  Scouting for adult beetles and monitoring their activity can provide valuable information for making management decisions, such as crop rotation or insecticide applications in the following season to disrupt the pest's lifecycle and minimize damage to future crops.
