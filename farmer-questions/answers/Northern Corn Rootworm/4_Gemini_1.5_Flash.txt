Bt corn hybrids, specifically those expressing the Cry3Bb1 protein, are highly effective against Northern Corn Rootworms (NCR). This protein specifically targets the digestive system of the rootworm larvae, leading to their death. However, the effectiveness of Bt corn can vary depending on factors like the specific hybrid, rootworm population density, and the stage of larval development. For optimal control, consider using hybrids expressing Cry3Bb1 and rotating with other non-Bt corn hybrids every 2-3 years to prevent the development of resistance in the rootworm population. Additionally, consider implementing other control measures like planting corn after the first flush of rootworm adults has passed, using insecticides, or utilizing resistant varieties.
