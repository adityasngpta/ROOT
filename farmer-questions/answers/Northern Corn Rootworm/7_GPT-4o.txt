Crop rotation significantly impacts Northern Corn Rootworm populations by disrupting their life cycle and reducing their numbers. Northern Corn Rootworms typically lay their eggs in cornfields, and the larvae hatch the following spring to feed on corn roots. When a different crop, such as soybeans or alfalfa, is planted in the field instead of corn, the larvae that hatch find themselves without their primary food source and are unable to survive. This practice effectively breaks the pest's life cycle, leading to a substantial decrease in their population. Over time, consistent crop rotation can help manage and control Northern Corn Rootworm infestations, reducing the need for chemical interventions and promoting sustainable farming practices.
