Early detection of grasshopper infestations in cereal crops is crucial for implementing effective control measures and minimizing potential damage. Keep a close eye out for these early indicators: **presence of young grasshoppers**, often seen congregating in patches or field margins, particularly in areas with lush vegetation or weedy patches.  You might also notice **small, irregular holes in the leaves of your cereal crops**. As these young grasshoppers feed, they create these distinctive patterns, which can be an early warning sign even before the infestation becomes severe.  Also, be vigilant in **monitoring for grasshopper nymphs**, which are smaller than adults and lack wings. Their presence, especially in large numbers, signals a growing infestation that requires attention.
