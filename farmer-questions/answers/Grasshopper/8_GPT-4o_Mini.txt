To effectively use trap crops for managing grasshopper infestations, select plants that are more attractive to grasshoppers than your main crops. Common trap crops include sorghum, millet, or certain legumes, which can lure grasshoppers away from your primary crops. Plant these trap crops around the perimeter of your fields or in designated areas within your farm to create a barrier. Monitor the trap crops regularly for grasshopper activity and, when populations are high, consider using physical removal methods such as hand-picking or employing insect vacuums. Additionally, you can apply insecticides specifically targeting grasshoppers on the trap crops, minimizing the impact on your main crops. This strategy not only helps in reducing grasshopper populations but also promotes a more sustainable approach to pest management by utilizing natural plant preferences.
