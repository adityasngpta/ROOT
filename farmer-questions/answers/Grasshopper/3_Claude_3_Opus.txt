The best time to scout for grasshoppers in your fields is during the early summer months, typically from late May to early July, depending on your location. This is when grasshopper nymphs begin to hatch and develop into adults. Scouting at this stage allows you to assess the severity of the infestation and take appropriate control measures before the grasshoppers cause significant damage to your crops.

When scouting, focus on areas with dense vegetation, such as field margins, ditches, and nearby uncultivated land, as these are the preferred habitats for grasshoppers. Scout during warm, sunny days when grasshoppers are most active. Walk through your fields in a zigzag pattern, making several stops to count the number of grasshoppers per square yard. If you find more than 15-20 grasshoppers per square yard, it may be necessary to implement control measures to protect your crops from potential damage. Regular monitoring throughout the growing season will help you stay on top of grasshopper populations and make informed decisions about management strategies.
