Trap cropping can be a useful strategy for managing grasshopper infestations. This method involves planting a small area of a highly attractive crop, like barley, wheat, or corn, around the edges of your main cash crop field. Grasshoppers will be drawn to these trap crops, concentrating their feeding in those areas. This makes it easier to monitor and control their populations, as they are contained within a smaller, manageable space. You can then target your pesticide applications or biological controls, like the fungus *Nosema locustae*, specifically on the trap crop area, minimizing the impact on the environment and beneficial insects within your main crop. Additionally, you can mow or till the trap crop after the grasshoppers have laid their eggs there, effectively destroying a significant portion of the next generation before they hatch and infest your main crop.
