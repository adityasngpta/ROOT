Early signs of grasshopper infestation in cereal crops include the presence of young grasshoppers, known as nymphs, which are typically less than 1/2 inch long and wingless. These nymphs can be found feeding on the leaves and stems of the cereal plants, causing irregular holes and ragged edges on the foliage. As the grasshopper population grows, you may notice an increasing number of adults, which are larger and have fully developed wings. They tend to feed more aggressively, causing significant damage to the plants. Another early indication is the presence of grasshopper droppings, which appear as small, dark pellets on the ground around the affected plants. Farmers should also be vigilant for signs of egg-laying, as female grasshoppers often lay their eggs in the soil near the crops. If left unchecked, a grasshopper infestation can lead to substantial crop losses, making early detection and timely management crucial for protecting cereal crops.
