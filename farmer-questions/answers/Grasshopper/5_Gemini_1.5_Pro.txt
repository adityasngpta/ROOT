Weather plays a significant role in grasshopper development, behavior, and population dynamics. Warm, dry weather generally favors grasshopper survival, development, and reproduction, leading to larger populations. Dry conditions during the egg-laying period result in higher egg survival rates because the soil is less likely to be detrimental to the eggs, and young nymphs can thrive in warm, dry weather with ample sunshine. Conversely, cool, wet weather can negatively impact grasshopper populations. Rainfall can directly kill grasshoppers through drowning or by increasing the prevalence of fungal diseases that can decimate grasshopper populations. Additionally, cool temperatures can slow down their development and reduce their reproductive rates. Understanding these weather influences can help farmers predict potential outbreaks. For example, a dry spring and early summer might signal a higher risk of grasshopper infestations, prompting farmers to implement early monitoring and control measures.
