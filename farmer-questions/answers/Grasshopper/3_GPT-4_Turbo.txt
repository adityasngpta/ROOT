The best time to scout for grasshoppers in your fields is during the early morning or late afternoon. These insects are most active during these cooler parts of the day, making it easier to spot and assess their population levels. Begin scouting in late spring to early summer, as this is when grasshopper nymphs start to emerge and feed. Continue monitoring throughout the summer as grasshopper populations can grow rapidly under favorable conditions. Pay special attention to field edges, as grasshoppers often migrate from grassy areas into crops. Early detection is crucial for effective management, allowing you to implement control measures before grasshoppers cause significant damage to your crops.
