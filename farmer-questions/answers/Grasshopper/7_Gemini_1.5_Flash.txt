Economic thresholds for grasshopper control in alfalfa depend on several factors, including the grasshopper species, alfalfa growth stage, and the value of the alfalfa crop.  Generally, it is recommended to treat when you have an average of 10-15 grasshoppers per square yard, or 5-7 grasshoppers per square yard if the alfalfa is less than 6 inches tall.  However, this threshold can be adjusted based on the specific grasshopper species, as some species are more damaging than others.  For example, the differential grasshopper is a particularly voracious eater and may require treatment at lower densities.  It is also important to consider the growth stage of the alfalfa.  Alfalfa is most susceptible to grasshopper damage when it is young and actively growing.  Therefore, it is generally recommended to treat sooner rather than later if you notice grasshopper activity in your alfalfa field.  

Ultimately, the best way to determine the appropriate economic threshold for your situation is to consult with a local agricultural extension agent or pest management specialist.  They can provide you with the most up-to-date information on grasshopper control and help you develop a customized pest management plan.
