Yes, there are several effective biological control agents for grasshoppers.  One of the most common is the naturally occurring fungus *Nosema locustae*, which infects grasshoppers and disrupts their feeding and reproduction. This fungus is commercially available in several products. Other naturally occurring pathogens that can be effective include bacteria (like *Bacillus thuringiensis*) and various protozoa.  Besides pathogens, parasitic wasps (specifically *Scelio spp.*) and flies lay their eggs on or inside grasshopper eggs or nymphs, ultimately killing them.  Birds, toads, and other vertebrates also consume grasshoppers, acting as natural predators.  Integrating these biological controls, along with other Integrated Pest Management strategies like habitat manipulation and chemical controls when necessary, can provide long-term, sustainable grasshopper management.
