Early signs of a grasshopper infestation in cereal crops include the presence of small, immature grasshoppers, known as nymphs, feeding on the leaves and stems of the plants. Farmers may notice small holes or ragged edges on the leaves, as well as the presence of fecal pellets on the soil or plant surfaces. As the infestation progresses, the nymphs will grow larger and become more visible, and the damage to the crop will become more extensive, with entire leaves or even whole plants being consumed. Additionally, farmers may observe the adult grasshoppers themselves, which are typically larger and have wings, flying or hopping around the field. Prompt identification and monitoring of these early signs can help farmers take timely action to control the infestation and minimize the impact on their cereal crop yields.
