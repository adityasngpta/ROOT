Grasshopper damage is often characterized by ragged chewing on leaf edges and irregular holes in plant tissue, as they consume large portions of leaves.  While other pests like caterpillars cause similar damage, grasshoppers tend to leave behind  more jagged and irregular feeding patterns. Caterpillars, especially smaller ones, create smoother, more rounded holes. Additionally, you might find grasshopper droppings, which resemble small, dark pellets, near the feeding sites. Observing the presence of grasshoppers in and around the field, particularly during the day when they are most active, can further confirm their responsibility for the damage.
