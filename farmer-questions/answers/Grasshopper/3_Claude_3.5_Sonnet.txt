The best time to scout for grasshoppers in your fields is typically during the late spring and early summer months. This period coincides with the hatching of grasshopper eggs and the emergence of nymphs, making it easier to detect and assess potential infestations. It's advisable to begin scouting efforts when temperatures consistently reach above 70°F (21°C), as this is when grasshoppers become more active and visible. Early morning or late afternoon are ideal times of day for scouting, as grasshoppers are more likely to be found basking in the sun during these cooler periods. Regular monitoring throughout the growing season is crucial, as grasshopper populations can increase rapidly under favorable conditions. By scouting early and frequently, you can identify potential problems before they escalate and implement timely control measures to protect your crops from significant damage.
