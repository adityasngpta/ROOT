The best time to scout for grasshoppers in your fields is during the early morning or late afternoon hours when the insects are most active. Grasshoppers tend to be less active during the hottest parts of the day, so conducting your scouting in the cooler morning or evening hours will allow you to more accurately assess their presence and population levels. It's recommended to walk through your fields in a systematic pattern, carefully inspecting plants and the ground for signs of grasshopper activity, such as the insects themselves, egg pods, or feeding damage. Pay close attention to field edges and areas with sparse vegetation, as these are common entry points and habitats for grasshoppers. Monitoring grasshopper populations early in the season can help you determine if control measures will be necessary to protect your crops from significant damage later on.
