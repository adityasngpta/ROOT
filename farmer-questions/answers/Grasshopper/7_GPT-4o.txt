For effective grasshopper control in alfalfa, economic thresholds are crucial to determine when intervention is necessary to prevent significant economic loss. Generally, the economic threshold for grasshoppers in alfalfa is around 8-12 grasshoppers per square yard in established stands. For newly seeded alfalfa, the threshold is lower, at about 3-5 grasshoppers per square yard, due to the increased vulnerability of young plants. Monitoring should be done regularly, especially during the early stages of infestation, to ensure timely action. If the population exceeds these thresholds, consider implementing control measures such as insecticides or biological controls to manage the pest population and protect your crop yield.
