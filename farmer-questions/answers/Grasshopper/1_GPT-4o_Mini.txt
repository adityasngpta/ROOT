Early signs of grasshopper infestation in cereal crops include the presence of chewed leaves, which may exhibit irregular edges or holes, and a noticeable reduction in plant vigor. Farmers should also look for the insects themselves, as they are often found in groups, especially during warm weather. Additionally, you may observe grasshoppers jumping away when the crops are disturbed. Another indicator is the presence of shed exoskeletons, which can be found near the base of plants. Monitoring for these signs early on is crucial, as timely intervention can help mitigate damage and protect your cereal crops from significant yield loss. Regular scouting and maintaining healthy crop conditions can also deter grasshopper populations.
