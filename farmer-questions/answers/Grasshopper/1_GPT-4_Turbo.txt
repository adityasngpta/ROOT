Early signs of grasshopper infestation in cereal crops include noticeable feeding damage on the leaves, where the edges appear chewed or ragged. Young plants may exhibit holes in the foliage or be completely defoliated in severe cases. Grasshoppers tend to start feeding on weeds and grasses around the field before moving into the main crop, so monitoring these areas can provide early warning signs. Additionally, you might observe an increased presence of grasshoppers in and around the field, particularly as temperatures rise since they are more active in warm weather. It's crucial to scout fields regularly, especially during dry and hot conditions which favor grasshopper proliferation. Early detection is key to managing their population effectively and minimizing crop damage.
