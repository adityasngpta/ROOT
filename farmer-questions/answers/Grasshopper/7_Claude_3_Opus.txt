When considering economic thresholds for grasshopper control in alfalfa, it's important to assess the level of infestation and potential damage to your crop. Generally, the economic threshold for grasshoppers in alfalfa is 8-15 grasshoppers per square yard, depending on the alfalfa's growth stage and value.

If the alfalfa is in the early growth stages (less than 6 inches tall), the economic threshold is lower, around 8 grasshoppers per square yard. At this stage, the alfalfa is more vulnerable to damage, and controlling the grasshopper population early can prevent significant yield loss.

For alfalfa that is taller than 6 inches, the economic threshold is higher, around 15 grasshoppers per square yard. Alfalfa at this stage can tolerate more damage, and the cost of treatment may not be justified unless the infestation is severe.

It's also essential to consider the species of grasshoppers present, as some species cause more damage than others. Additionally, factors such as the time of year, weather conditions, and the presence of natural predators can influence the decision to treat for grasshoppers.

Regularly scouting your alfalfa fields and assessing the grasshopper population is crucial for making informed decisions about control measures. If the grasshopper population exceeds the economic threshold, consider using an integrated pest management approach, which may include a combination of cultural, biological, and chemical control methods to effectively manage the infestation while minimizing the impact on beneficial insects and the environment.
