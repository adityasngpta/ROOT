Early signs of grasshopper infestation in cereal crops include visible damage to the leaves, such as irregular holes and edges that appear chewed. You may also notice grasshoppers themselves, especially during the early morning or late afternoon when they are most active. Additionally, look for an increase in bird activity, as birds often feed on grasshoppers. Another indicator is the presence of grasshopper egg pods in the soil, which can be found by digging around the base of the plants. Monitoring these signs early can help in taking timely action to manage the infestation before it causes significant damage to the crops.
