Insecticides vary in their effectiveness against grasshoppers and depend on several factors, including the grasshopper species, their growth stage (nymph or adult), the insecticide's mode of action, and the application method.  Generally, insecticides containing carbamates, organophosphates, and pyrethroids are effective against grasshoppers. However, it's essential to consider that repeated use of insecticides from the same chemical class can lead to insecticide resistance, decreasing their efficacy over time. For long-term control, integrating different control methods, like using biopesticides containing fungi or bacteria, or introducing natural predators like birds, can be more sustainable and reduce the risk of resistance. Always choose insecticides registered and labeled for grasshopper control and the specific crop, following the instructions on the label precisely. Consulting with local agricultural extension agents or pest management professionals can provide tailored recommendations for your situation.
