Economic thresholds for grasshopper control in alfalfa are not based on simple numbers like some other pests.  Instead, you should assess the potential damage in conjunction with the alfalfa's growth stage and value.  **Generally, treatment is economically justified when grasshopper populations reach 8-12 per square yard in young alfalfa or 15-20 per square yard in established stands.**  However, this can vary depending on factors like the market price of alfalfa, control costs, and grasshopper species present.  **During critical growth stages like pre-budding or pre-regrowth after cutting, consider treatment at lower thresholds** because even moderate defoliation can significantly impact yield and quality.  Always scout your fields thoroughly, paying attention to both grasshopper numbers and the extent of feeding damage to make informed decisions about whether control measures are economically warranted.
