The best time to scout for grasshoppers in your fields is during the late afternoon to early evening, typically between 4 PM and 7 PM. During this period, grasshoppers are more active and easier to spot as they feed on vegetation. Additionally, scouting should be done when the weather is warm and dry, as grasshoppers are less active in cooler or wet conditions. Regular scouting every few days during the peak growing season will help you monitor their population and assess any potential damage, allowing you to take timely action if necessary.
