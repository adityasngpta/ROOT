For grasshopper control in alfalfa, economic thresholds vary depending on the growth stage of the alfalfa and the density of the grasshopper population. Generally, the threshold is about 8 to 14 grasshoppers per square yard in young alfalfa. For more mature stands, the threshold increases to around 15 to 20 grasshoppers per square yard. It's important to monitor grasshopper populations early and regularly, as they can cause significant damage quickly, especially in young plants. When the number of grasshoppers exceeds these thresholds, it's economically justified to implement control measures to prevent significant loss of yield and quality in your alfalfa crop.
