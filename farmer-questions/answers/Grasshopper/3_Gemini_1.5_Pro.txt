The best time to scout for grasshoppers is in the morning or late afternoon when temperatures are cooler, and grasshoppers are less active, making them easier to spot.  Early morning is ideal as they are often clustered and sluggish before the day's heat sets in.  Focus your scouting efforts on field edges, ditches, and areas with lush vegetation, as these are prime grasshopper habitats.  Regular scouting, at least twice a week during periods of peak grasshopper activity, which is usually mid-summer to early fall, is crucial for effective management. This allows you to monitor population levels and implement control measures before significant damage occurs to your crops.
