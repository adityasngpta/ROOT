When it comes to managing grasshopper infestations in alfalfa, the economic threshold is an important consideration. The economic threshold refers to the pest population level at which the cost of control measures is justified by the expected yield loss. For grasshoppers in alfalfa, the recommended economic threshold is generally 15-20 grasshoppers per square yard during the first cutting and 8-12 grasshoppers per square yard during subsequent cuttings. This means that if the grasshopper population exceeds these levels, the cost of implementing control measures, such as insecticide application, is likely to be offset by the yield loss that would occur without intervention. It's important to monitor grasshopper populations regularly and make control decisions based on the economic threshold to ensure efficient and sustainable alfalfa production. Exceeding the threshold may warrant the use of targeted insecticide applications or other integrated pest management strategies to protect the crop and maintain profitability.
