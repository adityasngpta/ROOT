Trap cropping for grasshopper control involves planting specific, attractive crops around your main field to draw grasshoppers away from your valuable crops. This strategy relies on grasshoppers' preference for certain plants, like oats, sorghum, or sunflowers.  These trap crops are planted in smaller areas near your main field, acting as a "sacrifice" to divert the insects.  To maximize effectiveness, ensure your trap crops are planted early, before your main crops emerge, allowing the grasshoppers to find the trap crops first. Monitor the trap crops regularly for grasshopper activity. You can then use insecticides targeted for grasshoppers on the trap crops only, keeping the pesticide away from your valuable crops. This approach helps reduce the need for widespread insecticide application on your main crops, promoting sustainable pest management.
