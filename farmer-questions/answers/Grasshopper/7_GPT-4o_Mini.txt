For effective grasshopper control in alfalfa, the economic threshold typically ranges from 15 to 20 grasshoppers per square yard, depending on the growth stage of the alfalfa and the overall health of the crop. If the alfalfa is young or newly established, you may want to take action at the lower end of this threshold, as grasshoppers can cause significant damage during this vulnerable stage. Conversely, if the alfalfa is mature and well-established, you might consider the higher threshold. It's also important to assess the potential yield loss against the cost of control measures, as well as the presence of beneficial insects that may be affected by treatment. Regular monitoring and timely intervention are key to managing grasshopper populations effectively while minimizing economic losses.
