Yes, there are several biological control agents that can be used to manage grasshopper populations in agricultural settings. One of the most effective is the fungus *Metarhizium acridum*, specifically developed for grasshoppers and locusts. This fungus naturally infects grasshoppers, leading to their decline over time. Another biological agent is the protozoan *Nosema locustae*, which is particularly useful in long-term grasshopper management but may require repeated applications for effectiveness. Additionally, introducing natural predators such as birds, beetles, and spiders can help reduce grasshopper numbers. These biological control methods are environmentally friendly alternatives to chemical pesticides, helping to maintain ecological balance while managing pest populations.
