The best time to scout for grasshoppers in your fields is during the early morning hours, before the sun gets too high and they become more active. Grasshoppers are typically less active in the cooler morning temperatures, making them easier to spot and count. Early morning scouting also allows you to observe their feeding damage, which can be more noticeable when the plants are still wet with dew. You should focus your scouting efforts on areas where grasshoppers are most likely to be present, such as field edges, weedy areas, and areas with a high density of host plants. Pay attention to the size and number of grasshoppers, as well as any signs of damage to your crops. Regular scouting will help you identify and manage grasshopper infestations before they cause significant damage to your yield.
