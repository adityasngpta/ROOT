Trap crops can be an effective strategy for managing grasshopper infestations in your fields. To implement this method, plant a strip of highly attractive crops around the perimeter of your main crop area. Suitable trap crops for grasshoppers include alfalfa, wheat, or sorghum, as these plants are particularly appealing to the pests. The idea is to lure the grasshoppers away from your primary crop and concentrate them in the trap crop area. Once the grasshoppers are concentrated in the trap crop, you can more easily control them through targeted pesticide application or other management techniques. This approach not only reduces the overall pesticide use but also helps preserve beneficial insects in your main crop. For best results, monitor the trap crops regularly and take action when grasshopper populations reach threshold levels. Remember to time the planting of your trap crops so they mature slightly earlier than your main crop, making them more attractive to the grasshoppers. By using trap crops strategically, you can significantly reduce grasshopper damage to your primary crops while minimizing the environmental impact of pest control measures.
