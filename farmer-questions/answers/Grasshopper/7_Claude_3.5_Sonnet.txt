When considering economic thresholds for grasshopper control in alfalfa, it's important to balance the cost of treatment against potential crop losses. Generally, treatment is recommended when grasshopper populations reach 15-20 per square yard in field margins or 8-10 per square yard within the alfalfa field itself. However, these numbers can vary depending on the growth stage of the alfalfa and current market prices. For seedling alfalfa, which is more vulnerable, a lower threshold of 5-10 grasshoppers per square yard may be appropriate. It's also crucial to consider the life stage of the grasshoppers, as younger nymphs are easier to control than adults. Regular field scouting is essential to catch infestations early when they're most manageable. Keep in mind that these thresholds are guidelines, and you should also factor in the overall health of your crop, weather conditions, and the specific grasshopper species present when making treatment decisions.
