The best time to scout for grasshoppers in your fields is during the early morning or late afternoon when temperatures are cooler, and grasshoppers are less active. This is typically when they are more likely to be found resting on plants or the ground, making them easier to spot and count. Regular scouting should begin in the late spring to early summer, as this is when grasshopper nymphs hatch and start feeding. Consistent monitoring throughout the growing season is crucial, especially during dry periods, as grasshopper populations can increase rapidly under these conditions. By scouting during these optimal times, you can more accurately assess the infestation levels and take timely action to manage the pest population effectively.
