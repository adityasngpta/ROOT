Grasshopper damage on crops has some distinctive characteristics that can help you differentiate it from other pest damage. Typically, grasshoppers create irregular, jagged holes in leaves, often starting from the leaf edges and working inward. These holes are usually larger and more ragged than those caused by many other insects. Grasshoppers also tend to consume entire sections of leaves, sometimes leaving only the tougher veins behind. In severe infestations, you might notice stripped stems and stalks. Unlike some pests that target specific plant parts, grasshoppers are generalist feeders and can damage various parts of the plant, including leaves, stems, flowers, and fruits. Additionally, you may observe grasshopper frass (droppings) on the plants or ground nearby, which appears as small, dark pellets. If you suspect grasshopper damage, look for the insects themselves during the day, as they are most active in warm, sunny conditions. By considering these factors together – the type of damage, its distribution on the plant, and the presence of grasshoppers or their frass – you can more confidently identify grasshopper damage and distinguish it from that of other pests.
