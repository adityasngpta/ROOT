Trap crops can be a valuable tool in your fight against Stink Bugs. These pests are attracted to certain plants, so by strategically planting a "trap crop" that they prefer, you can lure them away from your main crops.  

Here's how to use trap crops effectively:

* **Choose the right trap crop:**  Stink bugs are attracted to plants in the legume family, particularly soybeans. Planting a small patch of soybeans near your main crop can draw the bugs away from your valuable plants. 
* **Timing is key:** Plant your trap crop a few weeks before your main crop to ensure the bugs are drawn to it during their most vulnerable stages.
* **Location matters:**  Place the trap crop on the windward side of your main crop. This will help direct the bugs towards the trap crop, reducing the chance they'll reach your main crop.
* **Combine with other methods:** Trap crops are most effective when used in conjunction with other pest control methods. Regularly scouting your fields, utilizing beneficial insects, and considering insecticide applications (if needed) can enhance the effectiveness of your trap crop strategy. 

By carefully selecting your trap crop, timing the planting, and considering the location, you can effectively use this technique to reduce Stink Bug pressure on your main crop and minimize losses.
