Using trap crops to manage Stink Bug infestations involves strategically planting certain crops that are more attractive to Stink Bugs than your main crops. These trap crops act as a lure, drawing the pests away from your primary agricultural produce. For instance, crops like sunflower, millet, or sorghum can be effective trap crops for Stink Bugs. Plant these trap crops around the perimeter of your main crop fields or in designated areas within the fields. Once the Stink Bugs congregate on the trap crops, you can then target these areas with specific pest control measures, such as insecticides or mechanical removal, thereby reducing the pest pressure on your main crops. This method not only helps in managing the pest population but also minimizes the use of chemicals on your primary crops, promoting a more sustainable farming practice. Regular monitoring of both the trap crops and the main crops is essential to ensure the effectiveness of this strategy and to make timely interventions as needed.
