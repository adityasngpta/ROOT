The best time to scout for stink bugs in your fields is during the late spring and early summer months, typically from May through July. This is when stink bug populations tend to be at their peak and the insects are actively feeding and reproducing. Scouting should be done in the early morning or late afternoon when stink bugs are most active and visible. Focus your scouting efforts on the edges of fields, as well as areas with dense vegetation or crop residue, as these provide ideal habitats for stink bugs. Regularly inspect plants, looking for the presence of the insects, their egg masses, and any signs of feeding damage. Monitoring stink bug populations throughout the growing season will help you determine the appropriate timing for any necessary control measures to protect your crops.
