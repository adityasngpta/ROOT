The best time to scout for stink bugs in your fields is during the early morning or late afternoon when temperatures are cooler and the bugs are more active. Specifically, scouting should be conducted from late spring through early fall, as this is when stink bugs are most prevalent and can cause significant damage to crops. Focus on areas near the edges of fields, as stink bugs often congregate there before moving into the main crop. Regular monitoring during this period will help you identify infestations early and implement control measures effectively, ensuring better protection for your crops.
