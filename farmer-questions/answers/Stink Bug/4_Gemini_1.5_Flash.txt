Insecticidal sprays can be effective against stink bugs, but the level of effectiveness depends on several factors, including the specific insecticide used, the timing of application, and the life stage of the stink bug.  

**Contact insecticides**, which kill insects on contact, can be effective against stink bugs, especially when applied during the nymph stage. However, adult stink bugs are more resistant to contact insecticides due to their hard exoskeletons. 

**Systemic insecticides**, which are absorbed by the plant and translocated throughout, can be more effective against adult stink bugs because they can be ingested as the insects feed on the plant. However, systemic insecticides can also be harmful to beneficial insects and pollinators, so it's crucial to use them cautiously and consider alternative pest control methods.

**Timing is crucial** when using insecticide sprays.  Stink bugs are most susceptible to insecticides during their early nymph stages, before they develop their tough outer shells.  Applying insecticides when the stink bugs are actively feeding, during the early morning or late evening hours, can increase effectiveness. 

It's important to choose the **right insecticide** for your situation, considering factors such as the type of crop, the stage of the stink bug infestation, and the potential impact on other organisms. 

Always **read the label** of any insecticide before applying it to your crops. Follow the recommended dosage and application instructions carefully to ensure effectiveness and minimize potential harm to beneficial insects and the environment. 

In addition to insecticidal sprays, other pest control methods like **cultural practices**, **natural enemies**, and **biological control** can also be effective against stink bugs.
