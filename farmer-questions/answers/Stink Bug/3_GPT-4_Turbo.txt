The best time to scout for stink bugs in your fields is typically during the late morning to early afternoon when temperatures are warmer, as stink bugs are more active during this time. Begin scouting from the start of the flowering stage of your crops and continue through the fruit development stages. It's crucial to inspect your crops at least once a week, focusing on the edges of the fields initially, as stink bugs often move from the borders inward. Use a sweep net or visual inspection of plants, looking closely at the fruits, flowers, and underneath leaves. Pay special attention during key developmental stages of your crops, as stink bugs tend to cause the most damage when fruits and seeds are forming. Regular monitoring helps in timely detection and management of stink bug infestations, allowing for more effective control measures to be implemented.
