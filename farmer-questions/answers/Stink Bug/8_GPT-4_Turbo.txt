Using trap crops is an effective strategy to manage stink bug infestations in your main crop. Trap cropping works by planting a crop that is more attractive to stink bugs around the perimeter of your main crop or in strategic locations within your fields. The idea is that stink bugs will congregate on these trap crops, making it easier to control them in a localized area rather than throughout your entire field. Suitable trap crops for stink bugs include sunflower, sorghum, and mustard, which are known to attract these pests more than many other crops. Once stink bugs are concentrated on the trap crops, you can apply targeted pest control measures such as insecticides or manual removal. This method not only reduces the use of chemicals across your entire farm but also helps in keeping the main crop healthier and reducing overall pest pressure. For optimal effectiveness, plant the trap crops before the main crop sows to ensure they are mature and attractive when stink bugs begin to appear. Regular monitoring of both the trap and main crops is crucial to determine when to implement control measures on the trap crops.
