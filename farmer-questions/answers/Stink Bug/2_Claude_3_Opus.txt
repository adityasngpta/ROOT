To differentiate Stink Bug damage from other pests, it's important to look for specific signs on the affected plants. Stink Bugs use their piercing-sucking mouthparts to feed on plant juices, causing distinctive damage. On fruits like tomatoes, peppers, and peaches, Stink Bug feeding results in small, circular depressions or corky spots on the surface, often referred to as "catfacing." These spots may be white, yellow, or brown and can make the fruit appear distorted or disfigured. On leaves, Stink Bug damage appears as small, light-colored stippling or spots where the bug has fed. In some cases, the leaves may turn yellow or brown and eventually die. Stink Bug damage is often scattered across the plant rather than concentrated in one area. By contrast, caterpillars and beetles typically chew holes or consume entire sections of leaves, while aphids and mites cause curling, distortion, or sticky honeydew on leaves. Recognizing these unique signs of Stink Bug damage will help you accurately identify the pest and take appropriate control measures.
