To effectively use trap crops for managing Stink Bug infestations, select plants that are more attractive to these pests than your main crops. Common trap crops include mustard, radishes, or certain legumes, which can lure Stink Bugs away from your primary crops. Plant these trap crops around the perimeter of your fields or in designated areas within your crop layout to create a barrier. Monitor the trap crops regularly for Stink Bug activity and, once populations are established, you can either remove the trap crops or treat them with insecticides to reduce the overall pest population. Additionally, ensure that the timing of planting the trap crops aligns with the life cycle of the Stink Bugs to maximize their effectiveness. This strategy not only helps in managing pest populations but can also promote biodiversity and reduce reliance on chemical controls, contributing to more sustainable farming practices.
