For stink bug control in cotton, the economic threshold typically recommended is when you observe an average of 5 to 10 stink bugs per 100 plants during the flowering to early boll development stages. This threshold can vary based on the growth stage of the cotton and the potential for yield loss. It's crucial to monitor your fields regularly, as the presence of stink bugs can lead to significant damage, particularly during the critical flowering and boll formation periods. If you reach or exceed this threshold, consider implementing control measures, such as insecticides, while also taking into account beneficial insects and the overall health of your ecosystem to ensure sustainable pest management. Always consult local extension services or agronomists for region-specific recommendations and to stay updated on any changes in thresholds based on evolving pest dynamics.
