Stink bug damage can be frustratingly similar to feeding damage from other pests, but there are some telltale signs to help you differentiate it.  Look closely for these signs: Stink bugs have piercing-sucking mouthparts, so instead of chewing holes, they leave behind small, discolored spots or lesions where they've fed.  These spots often have a characteristic dark pinprick in the center, surrounded by a lightened, almost bleached halo.  Fruits and vegetables like tomatoes, peppers, and beans are particularly susceptible, and the damage can cause deformities as they grow.  While other pests like aphids and spider mites also have piercing-sucking mouthparts, they tend to cause more widespread stippling or yellowing, unlike the distinct, individual spots left by stink bugs. Additionally, stink bugs inject a toxin while feeding, which can further distort plant tissue, causing catfacing in fruits or cloudy spots within the plant tissue itself.  Always consider the plant species affected and the overall pattern of damage to distinguish stink bug feeding from other pests.
