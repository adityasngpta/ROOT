The best time to scout for stink bugs in your fields is typically during the early morning or late afternoon hours when temperatures are cooler. Stink bugs are most active during these periods and tend to be more visible on plant surfaces. It's important to begin scouting as soon as crops start to develop fruit or seed pods, as this is when stink bugs are most likely to cause economic damage. For most crops, weekly scouting is recommended throughout the growing season, with increased frequency during critical growth stages or when stink bug populations are known to be high in your area. Pay special attention to field edges, as stink bugs often invade from surrounding vegetation. When scouting, carefully examine both the upper and lower surfaces of leaves, as well as developing fruit or pods, looking for both adults and nymphs. Using a sweep net can also be an effective method for detecting stink bug presence in your fields. Remember that early detection is key to implementing timely control measures and minimizing crop damage.
