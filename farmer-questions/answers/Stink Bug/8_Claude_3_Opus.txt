To manage Stink Bug infestations using trap crops, you can plant specific crops that are more attractive to the pests than your main crop. Stink Bugs are drawn to certain plants like sunflowers, sorghum, okra, corn, and beans. By strategically planting these trap crops around the perimeter or in strips within your main crop field, you can lure the Stink Bugs away from your primary crop. This concentrates the pest population in a smaller area, making it easier to control them using targeted insecticide applications or other methods like vacuuming or destroying the infested trap crop plants. Timing is crucial when using trap crops. Plant them earlier than your main crop so they are well-established and attractive to the Stink Bugs when they emerge. Monitor the trap crops regularly for Stink Bug activity and take appropriate control measures promptly. Incorporating trap cropping into your integrated pest management strategy can significantly reduce Stink Bug damage to your main crop while minimizing the need for widespread insecticide use.
