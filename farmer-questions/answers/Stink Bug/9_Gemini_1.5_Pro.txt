Stink bug damage can significantly impact crop yield long-term, extending beyond the immediate damage to developing fruit or seed. While visible damage like scarring and deformation directly reduce marketable yield, stink bug feeding can also introduce pathogens that cause secondary infections, further diminishing yield and affecting future crops.  Additionally, their feeding disrupts plant physiology, hindering growth and reducing overall productivity in subsequent seasons.  This delayed impact on plant vigor and health underscores the importance of proactive, integrated pest management strategies to effectively control stink bug populations and minimize both their immediate and lasting effects on crop yield.
