Stink bug damage in crops has some distinctive characteristics that can help differentiate it from damage caused by other pests. Typically, stink bug feeding results in small, discolored, sunken areas on fruits and vegetables. On corn, you might notice small brown spots on kernels, while on soybeans, you may see flattened pods or discolored, shriveled seeds. In cotton, stink bugs can cause dark spots on bolls and stained lint. The damage often appears as clusters of small puncture marks, sometimes accompanied by a water-soaked appearance. Unlike some other pests, stink bugs don't usually create large holes or extensively chew plant tissue. Instead, their damage is more subtle and localized. Additionally, you may notice a distinctive unpleasant odor in heavily infested areas, which is a telltale sign of stink bug presence. If you're unsure, it's always best to consult with a local agricultural extension agent who can provide a definitive identification and tailored management strategies for your specific crop and region.
