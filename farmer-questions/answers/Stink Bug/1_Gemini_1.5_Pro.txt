Early detection of stink bugs in soybean fields is crucial for implementing timely control measures and minimizing potential yield loss.  Begin scouting for stink bugs at the edges of soybean fields, as these pests often move in from field borders. Look for small, dark spots on plant leaves, which are a telltale sign of stink bug feeding. These spots are caused by the stink bug's piercing-sucking mouthparts as they extract plant fluids. As feeding progresses, the affected areas may become yellow or necrotic. Additionally, check for deformed pods and seeds, as stink bug feeding during pod development can lead to distorted growth. Another sign is the presence of stink bug eggs, which are typically laid in clusters of 20-30 on the undersides of leaves. These eggs are light green to yellow and barrel-shaped. Early detection of these signs allows for prompt action, preventing the stink bug population from reaching damaging levels and ensuring a healthy soybean yield.
