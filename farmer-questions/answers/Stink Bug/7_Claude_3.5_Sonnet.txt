Economic thresholds for Stink Bug control in cotton can vary depending on the growth stage of the crop and the specific region, but there are some general guidelines you can follow. During the first two weeks of bloom, the threshold is typically around 20% internal boll damage or 1 stink bug per 6 row-feet. As the cotton progresses into weeks 3-5 of bloom, the threshold usually drops to about 10-15% internal boll damage or 1 stink bug per 6 row-feet. In the later stages of boll development (weeks 6-7), the threshold may increase again to around 20% internal boll damage, as the bolls become more resistant to damage. It's important to note that these thresholds can be adjusted based on the value of the crop and the cost of control measures. Regular scouting and monitoring of your cotton fields is crucial to accurately determine when these thresholds are reached and to make timely decisions on pest control interventions. Always consult with your local agricultural extension service for region-specific recommendations, as they can provide more tailored advice based on local conditions and pest pressures.
