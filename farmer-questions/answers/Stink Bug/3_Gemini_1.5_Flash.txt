The best time to scout for stink bugs in your fields is during the early morning hours, when they are most active and visible. Stink bugs are typically found hiding under leaves or in the folds of plants during the day to avoid the heat. In the early morning, they will be feeding and moving around on the plants, making them easier to spot. It is also helpful to scout after a rain event, as the bugs will be more active in the moist conditions. Additionally, you should check areas of the field that are close to the edge or have a history of stink bug infestations. This will help you identify infestations early on, allowing you to take appropriate action to manage the pests before they cause significant damage to your crop.
