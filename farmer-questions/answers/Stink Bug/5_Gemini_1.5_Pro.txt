Stink bugs are a significant pest for a variety of crops, impacting both yield and quality. Implementing integrated pest management strategies that prioritize cultural practices can effectively manage stink bug populations and minimize crop damage.  A key practice is rotating crops, especially away from preferred hosts like soybeans and corn, to disrupt their lifecycle and reduce their overwintering sites.  Planting trap crops like sunflowers or sorghum can lure stink bugs away from cash crops and allow for focused management in a smaller area.  Keeping fields clear of weeds and crop residue eliminates their hiding spots and food sources, making the environment less favorable for stink bugs.  Additionally, planting later in the season can help avoid peak stink bug populations, reducing the initial infestation pressure on crops.
