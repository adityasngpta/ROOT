Early signs of a stink bug infestation in soybean fields include the presence of the adult bugs themselves, as well as signs of their feeding damage on the plants. Adult stink bugs are shield-shaped insects that are typically green, brown, or gray in color. They can often be seen crawling on the leaves, stems, or pods of soybean plants. Another early indicator is the appearance of small, round, discolored spots on the leaves, stems, or pods, which are caused by the stink bugs' piercing-sucking mouthparts as they feed on the plant's fluids. This feeding damage can lead to deformed or aborted pods, as well as reduced seed quality and yield. Farmers should regularly inspect their soybean fields, especially during the pod-filling stage, to monitor for the presence of stink bugs and signs of their feeding activity. Catching an infestation early is crucial for implementing effective management strategies to protect the crop.
