Stink bug damage on crops can be distinguished by observing the specific signs they leave on fruits and plants. Typically, stink bugs cause a unique type of injury where they pierce the plant tissue and suck out the sap. On fruits, this results in small, necrotic areas that are initially sunken and may appear as cloudy spots beneath the skin. These spots often become darker and harder over time. In contrast, damage from other pests like caterpillars or beetles usually involves chewing on the leaves or fruits, leaving holes or jagged edges. Additionally, stink bugs can cause leaf stippling, where tiny discolored dots appear on the leaves, and in severe cases, can lead to leaf curling or distortion. Observing these specific patterns can help you accurately identify stink bug damage and differentiate it from damage caused by other pests.
