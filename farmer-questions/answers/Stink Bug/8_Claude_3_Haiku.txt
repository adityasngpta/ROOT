Using trap crops is an effective strategy for managing stink bug infestations in agricultural settings. Trap crops are plants that are more attractive to the target pest than the main crop, drawing them away from the valuable plants. For stink bugs, good trap crop options include sunflowers, sorghum, or certain legumes like soybeans or alfalfa. Plant the trap crop around the perimeter of your main crop field, ensuring it is established and attractive to the stink bugs before the main crop matures. This will draw the stink bugs to the trap crop, where you can then target them with insecticide applications or other management techniques without risking damage to your primary crop. Regularly monitor the trap crop and main crop, and be prepared to reapply insecticides to the trap crop as needed to maintain its effectiveness. Using trap crops in conjunction with other integrated pest management practices can significantly reduce stink bug pressure and protect your valuable crop yields.
