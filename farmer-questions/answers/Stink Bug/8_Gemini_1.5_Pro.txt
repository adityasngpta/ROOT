Trap cropping can be a valuable tool in managing stink bug infestations. This method involves planting a small area of a crop that is more attractive to stink bugs than your main crop. Good choices for trap crops for stink bugs include sunflowers, sorghum, and millet. These trap crops should be planted earlier than your main crop or in a border surrounding it to lure the stink bugs away. This concentrates the pest population, making it easier to monitor and control them. You can then target the trap crop with insecticides or destroy the concentrated stink bug population, preventing them from spreading and damaging your main crop. Remember to monitor the trap crop regularly to determine the effectiveness and adjust your pest management strategy as needed.
