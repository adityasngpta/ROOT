Stink bugs are notorious for causing damage to a variety of crops, but their feeding patterns can be tricky to distinguish from other pests. To effectively identify stink bug damage, focus on the shape of the injury and the presence of small, dark spots. Stink bugs have piercing-sucking mouthparts, leaving behind a characteristic "stippling" pattern on leaves, fruits, and stems. These small, discolored spots are often irregular in shape, unlike the more symmetrical holes created by chewing insects. Furthermore, stink bugs tend to attack developing fruit, leading to misshapen growth and potential fruit drop. The presence of these telltale signs, alongside the occasional sighting of the adult bugs or their shed skins, can help confirm a stink bug infestation. Be sure to consider the specific crop you are growing, as different stink bugs target different plants. Consulting with your local agricultural extension service or a pest management professional can provide further confirmation and specific recommendations for control measures.
