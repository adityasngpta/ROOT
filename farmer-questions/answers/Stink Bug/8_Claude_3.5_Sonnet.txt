Trap crops can be an effective strategy for managing Stink Bug infestations in your fields. To implement this method, plant attractive crops around the perimeter of your main crop or in strategic locations within the field. Stink Bugs are particularly drawn to plants like sunflowers, sorghum, millet, or early-maturing soybean varieties. These trap crops act as decoys, luring the pests away from your primary crop. Once the Stink Bugs concentrate on the trap crops, you can more easily control them through targeted pesticide applications or physical removal. It's important to monitor both your main crop and the trap crops regularly, as timing is crucial for this method to be effective. You should be prepared to take action when Stink Bug populations reach threshold levels in the trap crops. Additionally, consider planting your trap crops slightly earlier than your main crop to ensure they are more attractive when the Stink Bugs arrive. By using trap crops strategically, you can reduce overall pesticide use in your main crop while still effectively managing Stink Bug populations.
