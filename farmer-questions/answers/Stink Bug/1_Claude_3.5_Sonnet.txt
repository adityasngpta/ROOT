Early signs of stink bug infestation in soybean fields can be subtle but important to recognize for timely intervention. Farmers should look for small, shield-shaped insects on the plants, particularly on developing pods and stems. These pests are typically green or brown in color and about 1/2 inch long. One of the first indicators is the appearance of small, dark spots on the surface of soybean pods where stink bugs have inserted their piercing mouthparts to feed. Leaves may show yellowing or wilting in patches across the field. As the infestation progresses, farmers might notice delayed maturity in affected plants, resulting in what's known as "stay-green" syndrome where parts of the field remain green while the rest is ready for harvest. Additionally, misshapen or flattened pods can be a sign of stink bug damage. Regular scouting, especially during pod development stages, is crucial for early detection. If farmers notice these signs or suspect stink bug presence, they should consider implementing appropriate management strategies to prevent yield loss and quality reduction in their soybean crop.
