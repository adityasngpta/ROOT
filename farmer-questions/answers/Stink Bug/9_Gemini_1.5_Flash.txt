Stink bugs, particularly the brown marmorated stink bug (BMSB), can significantly impact crop yield over the long term. They feed on developing fruits, vegetables, and grains, causing substantial damage that reduces quality and quantity. Their feeding punctures the plant tissue, leading to deformed fruits, blemishes, and premature ripening. This reduces market value and overall yield. In addition, stink bugs can introduce fungal diseases through their feeding wounds, further compromising crop health and leading to losses. These pests also have a high reproductive rate, which can lead to rapid population growth and sustained damage over several growing seasons. Long-term infestations can ultimately result in reduced crop yields, economic losses, and a negative impact on farm profitability. Early detection and proactive management strategies are crucial to minimizing the long-term impact of stink bugs on crop yield. This includes using integrated pest management (IPM) techniques, such as scouting for pests, using biological control methods, and applying insecticides only when necessary and with proper timing.
