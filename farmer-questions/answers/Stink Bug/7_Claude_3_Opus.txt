When considering economic thresholds for stink bug control in cotton, it's important to balance the potential yield loss caused by the pest against the cost of control measures. Generally, treatment is recommended when stink bug populations reach 1 bug per 6 row feet or exceed 20% internal boll damage during weeks 3-5 of bloom. However, this threshold may vary slightly depending on the cotton variety, growing conditions, and stage of crop development.

Scouting for stink bugs should begin at first bloom and continue weekly until the last harvestable boll is 25 days old. Pay close attention during the third through fifth weeks of bloom, as this is when stink bugs can cause the most economic damage. Use a drop cloth or sweep net to monitor stink bug populations and assess internal boll damage by examining at least 20 quarter-sized bolls per field.

If the economic threshold is reached, consider using insecticides labeled for stink bug control in cotton. Consult your local extension office or crop advisor for the most effective and appropriate products for your specific situation. Proper timing and application of control measures are crucial for minimizing yield loss and maximizing the return on investment in pest management.
