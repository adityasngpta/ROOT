Stink Bug damage can be differentiated from other pests by closely examining the specific symptoms they cause on crops. Stink Bugs typically use their piercing-sucking mouthparts to feed, which results in small, discolored, and sunken spots on fruits, vegetables, and leaves. On fruits, such as tomatoes or apples, you might notice deformed growth, catfacing, or corky areas under the skin. On leaves, the damage often appears as stippling or small necrotic spots. Additionally, Stink Bugs can cause seed loss and delayed maturity in crops like soybeans. Unlike chewing pests that leave behind holes or ragged edges, Stink Bug damage is more subtle and often involves discoloration and deformation. Observing the presence of the bugs themselves, which are shield-shaped and emit a distinctive odor when disturbed, can also help confirm their activity. Regular scouting and monitoring are essential to accurately identify and manage Stink Bug infestations.
