Early signs of Stink Bug infestation in soybean fields include the presence of the bugs themselves, which are typically green or brown and can be found on the leaves, stems, and pods of the plants. You may notice yellowing or wilting of leaves, particularly in the upper canopy, as the bugs feed on the plant sap. Additionally, look for small, dark spots on the pods, which can indicate feeding damage. If you observe a significant number of stink bugs, especially during the pod development stage, itâ€™s crucial to monitor the situation closely, as they can cause yield loss and affect seed quality. Regular scouting and early detection are key to managing their populations effectively, so consider implementing integrated pest management strategies if you suspect an infestation.
