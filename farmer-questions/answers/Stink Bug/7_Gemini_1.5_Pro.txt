Determining economic thresholds for stink bug control in cotton involves considering several factors that can vary significantly across different regions and growing seasons. There isn't a universal number of stink bugs per plant that definitively triggers insecticide application.  Instead, you need to assess the potential damage and weigh it against the cost of control. Scout your fields regularly from the early square stage through boll development, paying close attention to the presence of stink bugs and their damage symptoms like stained lint, deformed bolls, and potential yield reduction. Consult your local extension service for region-specific recommendations on economic thresholds and recommended insecticide programs. They can provide up-to-date information on thresholds, considering factors like cotton prices, insecticide costs, and the presence of beneficial insects that may contribute to natural pest control in your area.
