Early signs of stink bug infestation in soybean fields include visible damage to the pods and seeds. You might notice small, irregular dark spots on the pods, which are entry points where stink bugs have fed. The feeding can cause the seeds inside the pods to become shriveled, discolored, or deformed. Additionally, stink bugs can be directly observed on the plants; they are typically shield-shaped and can vary in color from green to brown. It's also common to see yellowing or wilting in parts of the plant if the infestation is severe. Regular scouting, especially during the pod-filling stages, is crucial for early detection and management of stink bug populations in soybean fields.
