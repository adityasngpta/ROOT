The economic threshold for stink bugs in cotton varies depending on the growth stage of the crop. Generally, during the flowering and boll formation stages, a common threshold is when you observe stink bugs on 20% of plants with one or more stink bugs per 6 feet of row during the first two weeks of bloom. After the first two weeks of bloom, the threshold typically increases to 30% of plants with stink bugs. It's important to scout both the field edges and interiors, as stink bugs may be more concentrated in certain areas. Regular monitoring should continue through the mid-boll stage until the bolls begin to open. Decisions on control measures should also consider the species of stink bug present, as some may cause more damage than others. Always integrate pest management strategies, including cultural practices and chemical controls, to manage stink bug populations effectively and sustainably.
