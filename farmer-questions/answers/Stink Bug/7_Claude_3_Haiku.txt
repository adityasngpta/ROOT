When it comes to managing stink bug infestations in cotton, using economic thresholds is crucial for making informed and cost-effective control decisions. The economic threshold for stink bugs in cotton is generally considered to be 1 stink bug per 6 row feet during the first 3 weeks of bloom. This means that if you are finding an average of 1 stink bug per 6 row feet of cotton during this critical period, it is likely economically justified to implement control measures. However, it's important to note that this threshold may need to be adjusted based on factors such as cotton market prices, control costs, and the specific stink bug species present in your field. Additionally, scouting your cotton fields regularly and accurately identifying the stink bug species is essential for making the best management decisions. By using this economic threshold as a guideline and considering your unique farm conditions, you can effectively manage stink bug infestations in your cotton crop while optimizing your economic returns.
