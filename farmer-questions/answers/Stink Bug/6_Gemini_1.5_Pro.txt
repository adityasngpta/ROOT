Weather conditions significantly influence stink bug activity and population dynamics.  Warm temperatures, particularly during spring and early summer, accelerate stink bug development, leading to faster reproduction rates and potentially larger populations. Conversely, extremely high temperatures above 95Â°F can negatively impact their survival and reproduction. Adequate rainfall provides favorable conditions for stink bug development and survival, while drought stress can reduce their populations. Mild winters can allow for higher overwintering survival rates, resulting in larger populations the following spring. Wind currents play a role in stink bug dispersal, with strong winds facilitating their movement into new areas. Monitoring weather patterns can help predict stink bug activity and guide management decisions, such as timing insecticide applications or implementing cultural control methods like trap crops.
