The best time to scout for stink bugs in your fields is during the pod development and seed filling stages of your crops, particularly soybeans. This period usually occurs from late July through September, depending on your location and planting dates. Stink bugs can cause significant damage to developing pods and seeds, leading to yield loss and reduced crop quality. It's essential to monitor your fields weekly during this critical time, paying close attention to field edges where stink bugs often initially appear. Focus your scouting efforts on the upper canopy of the plants, as stink bugs prefer to feed on the younger, more tender growth. If you notice an increasing population of stink bugs or observe damage to the pods, consider implementing control measures based on the economic threshold for your specific crop and region. Consult with your local extension office or agricultural advisor for the most up-to-date information on economic thresholds and management strategies for stink bugs in your area.
