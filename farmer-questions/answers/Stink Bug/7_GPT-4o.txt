The economic threshold for Stink Bug control in cotton typically depends on the growth stage of the cotton and the level of infestation. Generally, during the early bloom stage, the threshold is around 20% internal boll damage. As the cotton progresses to the mid-bloom stage, the threshold can be adjusted to 10-15% internal boll damage. For late bloom stages, the threshold is often set at 10% internal boll damage. These thresholds are designed to balance the cost of pest control with the potential yield loss, ensuring that interventions are economically justified. Regular scouting and monitoring are crucial to accurately assess the level of infestation and make timely decisions. Additionally, integrating cultural practices and biological controls can help manage Stink Bug populations more sustainably.
