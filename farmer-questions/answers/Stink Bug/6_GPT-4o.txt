Weather conditions significantly influence Stink Bug activity and population dynamics. Warm temperatures, particularly those above 70°F (21°C), are conducive to their development, feeding, and reproduction. Stink Bugs are less active during cooler weather, which can slow their life cycle and reduce their population growth. Additionally, mild winters can lead to higher survival rates of overwintering adults, resulting in larger populations in the following growing season. Conversely, harsh winters can reduce their numbers. Rainfall also plays a role; excessive moisture can negatively impact their eggs and nymphs, while dry conditions may favor their proliferation. Understanding these weather-related factors can help farmers anticipate Stink Bug infestations and implement timely pest management strategies.
