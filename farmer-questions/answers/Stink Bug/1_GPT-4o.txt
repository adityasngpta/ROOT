Early signs of Stink Bug infestation in soybean fields include the presence of the bugs themselves, which are shield-shaped and can vary in color from green to brown. Farmers may notice small clusters of eggs on the undersides of leaves, which are typically barrel-shaped and laid in groups. Additionally, feeding damage is a key indicator; look for discolored or deformed pods, as well as seeds that appear shriveled or punctured. Another sign is the presence of "stay-green" syndrome, where affected plants remain green and do not mature properly. Regular scouting and monitoring for these signs can help in early detection and timely management of Stink Bug infestations.
