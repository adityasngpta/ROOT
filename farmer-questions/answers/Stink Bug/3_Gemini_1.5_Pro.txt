Scouting for stink bugs is crucial to protecting your crops from damage.  Begin scouting in early spring as temperatures warm and stink bugs become active.  Focus on field edges initially, as these pests overwinter in nearby woods and often congregate in these areas first. Continue scouting throughout the growing season, especially during flowering and pod development stages when crops are most susceptible to stink bug damage. Pay close attention 2-3 weeks after planting and again after any significant weather events, like heavy rain, that can drive stink bugs into fields. Regular and consistent scouting will allow you to monitor population levels and determine if and when control measures are needed.
