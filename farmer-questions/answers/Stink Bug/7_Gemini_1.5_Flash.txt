Determining the economic threshold for stink bug control in cotton requires careful consideration of several factors, including the variety of stink bug present, the growth stage of your cotton, the current market price of cotton, and the cost of insecticide application. Generally, the economic threshold for stink bug control is reached when 1-2 stink bugs per 100 plants are found in the early fruiting stages of cotton.  However, this number can vary based on the specific species of stink bug, as some are more damaging than others. For example, brown stink bugs can be tolerated in higher numbers than green stink bugs. As your cotton approaches maturity, the economic threshold can increase, as the plant is more resistant to damage. Additionally, if the market price of cotton is high, it might be more profitable to control stink bugs at a lower threshold. Conversely, if the cost of insecticide application is high, you might choose to tolerate higher numbers of stink bugs before implementing control measures. Regularly scouting your cotton fields and using a decision-making tool, like a pest management guide, can help you determine the optimal time to apply control measures based on your specific circumstances.
