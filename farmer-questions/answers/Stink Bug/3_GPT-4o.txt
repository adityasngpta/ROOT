The best time to scout for Stink Bugs in your fields is during the early morning or late afternoon when temperatures are cooler, as these pests are more active and easier to spot. Regular scouting should begin early in the growing season, particularly from the flowering stage through the pod-filling stage for crops like soybeans, as this is when Stink Bugs are most likely to cause significant damage. Consistent monitoring throughout the season is crucial, as it allows for early detection and timely intervention, helping to minimize crop damage and reduce the need for chemical controls.
