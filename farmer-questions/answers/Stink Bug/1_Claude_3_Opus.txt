Early signs of Stink Bug infestation in soybean fields include the presence of adult Stink Bugs on the plants, especially along field edges. These shield-shaped insects are typically brown, green, or gray in color. Farmers should also look for small, round holes in the leaves caused by Stink Bug feeding. As the infestation progresses, the bugs will feed on the developing soybean pods, causing visible puncture marks and distorted or shriveled beans within the pods. Scouting for Stink Bugs should begin when the plants start developing pods and continue through the seed development stages. If more than one Stink Bug per foot of row is found, control measures may be necessary to prevent significant yield loss. Farmers should consult with local extension services or pest management professionals to determine the best course of action based on the severity of the infestation and the growth stage of the soybean crop.
