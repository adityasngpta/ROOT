To identify Grape Colaspis larvae in corn fields, look for small, white, C-shaped grubs with brown heads, typically measuring about 1/8 to 1/6 inch long. These larvae feed on corn roots, causing damage that may lead to stunted growth, wilting, and yellowing of the leaves. Grape Colaspis larvae are usually found in the soil around the base of the corn plant, and their presence can be confirmed by carefully digging up and examining the roots.

Infestations often occur in patches within a field, so pay close attention to areas where the corn appears stressed or underdeveloped. Scouting for larvae should be done during the early stages of corn growth, particularly in fields with a history of Grape Colaspis infestations or in areas where the pest is known to be prevalent. If you suspect an infestation, consult with a local extension agent or crop consultant to confirm the presence of Grape Colaspis larvae and develop an appropriate management plan.
