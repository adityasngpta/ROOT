Grape colaspis larvae are a common pest in corn fields, and identifying them early is crucial for effective management.  These larvae are white to cream-colored grubs with brown heads and a distinctive "C" shape.  They measure about 1/2 inch long when fully grown. A key identifying feature is the presence of three pairs of tiny legs near the head, typical of many beetle larvae.  You'll find them primarily in the soil, feeding on corn roots.  Look for damage symptoms in your cornfield like stunting, wilting, and uneven growth, particularly in younger plants, as these can indicate a potential infestation.  Digging around the roots of affected plants will help expose the larvae for identification.
