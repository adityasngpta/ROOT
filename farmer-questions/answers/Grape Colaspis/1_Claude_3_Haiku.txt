Grape Colaspis larvae, also known as grape colaspis grubs, can be a significant pest in corn fields. These small, white, C-shaped grubs feed on the roots of corn plants, causing stunted growth, wilting, and reduced yields. To identify Grape Colaspis larvae in your corn fields, look for the following characteristics: the grubs are approximately 1/2 inch long, have a white or cream-colored body, and a brown head capsule. They can be found feeding on the roots of corn plants, often in clusters. The larvae typically have three pairs of small legs near the head. To confirm the presence of Grape Colaspis, you can dig around the base of corn plants and inspect the soil for the distinctive grubs. If you find these pests in your fields, it's important to take prompt action to manage the infestation and protect your corn crop.
