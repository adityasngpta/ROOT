Determining economic thresholds for Grape Colaspis (also known as the grape rootworm) in corn and soybean is tricky because there isn't a widely accepted, standardized threshold. This is due to factors like varying susceptibility of corn and soybean varieties, the stage of crop development when infestation occurs, and the effectiveness of control measures. 

However, here's a general guideline to consider:

**Corn:**  In corn, Grape Colaspis larvae can cause significant damage by feeding on roots, leading to stunted growth and reduced yields. The economic threshold is generally considered to be **1-2 larvae per plant** at the V3-V5 growth stage (when the corn plant has 3-5 visible leaves).  However, in fields with a history of heavy infestations or where susceptible varieties are planted, a lower threshold of **0.5 larvae per plant** might be more appropriate.

**Soybean:** In soybean, Grape Colaspis larvae feed on the roots and can cause significant damage to developing plants, leading to reduced yields. The economic threshold is generally considered to be **1-2 larvae per plant** at the V1-V3 growth stage (when the soybean plant has 1-3 visible leaves). However, in fields with a history of heavy infestations or where susceptible varieties are planted, a lower threshold of **0.5 larvae per plant** might be more appropriate.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Scout regularly:**  Regular field scouting is essential to assess the severity of the infestation and determine if control measures are necessary. 
* **Soil type:** The economic threshold may vary depending on soil type.  In sandy soils, larvae may be more active and require earlier control.
* **Previous infestations:**  Fields with a history of Grape Colaspis infestations may have a higher risk of economic damage and require more vigilant monitoring.

It's best to consult with your local extension service or a certified crop consultant for specific recommendations tailored to your farm and situation.
