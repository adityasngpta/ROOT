Grape Colaspis damage in grapevines can be identified by several characteristic signs. The most noticeable indicator is the presence of small, irregular holes in the leaves, giving them a shot-hole appearance. These holes are typically clustered and may be more concentrated near the leaf margins. Adult beetles feed on the leaf tissue between the veins, creating a skeletonized pattern. In severe infestations, you may observe defoliation, particularly in young vines. Additionally, the larvae of Grape Colaspis can damage the root system, leading to stunted growth, yellowing of leaves, and reduced vigor in affected vines. If you suspect Grape Colaspis damage, inspect the undersides of leaves for the presence of small, oval-shaped, light brown beetles, which are about 3-4 mm long. Early detection is crucial for implementing effective control measures and minimizing the impact on grape production.
