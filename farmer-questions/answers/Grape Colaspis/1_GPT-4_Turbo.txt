Grape Colaspis larvae, often referred to as the "grape colaspis" or "corn colaspis," can be identified in corn fields by examining the roots and root hairs of corn plants for damage, as these larvae primarily feed on them. The larvae are small, about 1/4 inch long, and have a white to cream-colored body with a brown head. They are C-shaped, which is typical of many soil-dwelling insect larvae. To confirm their presence, you might need to carefully dig around the base of affected corn plants and sift through the soil to find them. Look for signs of feeding damage such as stunted growth, wilting, or yellowing of plants, which typically appear in patches across the field. Early detection is crucial for effective management, so regularly monitoring your fields for these signs during the early growing stages of corn is recommended.
