Neonicotinoid seed treatments can be moderately effective against Grape Colaspis (Colaspis brunnea) in certain crops, particularly soybeans and corn. These systemic insecticides are taken up by the growing plant and can provide protection against early-season feeding by Grape Colaspis larvae on roots and seedlings. However, their effectiveness may vary depending on factors such as pest pressure, environmental conditions, and timing of pest emergence. While neonicotinoids can reduce Grape Colaspis populations and minimize damage in some cases, they may not provide complete control, especially under high pest pressure or when adult beetles emerge later in the season. It's important to note that the use of neonicotinoids has come under scrutiny due to potential impacts on beneficial insects, so farmers should consider integrated pest management strategies and consult local extension services for the most appropriate and sustainable control methods for their specific situation.
