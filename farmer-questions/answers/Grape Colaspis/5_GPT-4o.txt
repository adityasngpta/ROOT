The economic thresholds for Grape Colaspis in corn and soybean are critical for determining when to implement control measures to prevent economic loss. For corn, the threshold is generally when 10% or more of the plants show signs of damage, such as stunted growth or root feeding, particularly during the early stages of plant development. For soybeans, the threshold is typically when 20% or more of the plants exhibit similar damage symptoms. These thresholds are guidelines and can vary based on factors such as plant growth stage, environmental conditions, and overall plant health. Monitoring fields regularly and accurately assessing the extent of damage is essential for making informed decisions about pest management to ensure economic viability and sustainability.
