Grape Colaspis feeding on grapevines can manifest in several ways. One of the most noticeable signs is the appearance of their feeding marks on the leaves.  Adult beetles create distinctive, round holes, almost like they've been punched out,  concentrated near the leaf veins.  Young grapevines, especially those in sandy soils, may exhibit stunted growth or even wilting due to the grubs feeding on their roots.  Upon closer inspection of the roots, you might find them scarred or chewed.  If you observe any of these symptoms in your vineyard, it's crucial to determine if Grape Colaspis is the culprit and take appropriate action to mitigate further damage.
