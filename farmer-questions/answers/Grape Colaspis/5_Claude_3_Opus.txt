The economic thresholds for Grape Colaspis (Colaspis brunnea) differ between corn and soybean crops. In corn, the economic threshold is reached when an average of 2 or more larvae are found per plant at the seedling stage. At this level of infestation, the feeding damage from the larvae can significantly impact plant growth and yield potential, warranting control measures. 

For soybeans, the economic threshold is slightly higher, with an average of 4 or more larvae per plant at the seedling stage. Soybeans tend to have a greater ability to compensate for early-season damage compared to corn. However, if the infestation reaches or exceeds this threshold, the potential yield loss justifies the implementation of control strategies.

It's important to note that these thresholds are general guidelines, and factors such as crop growth stage, overall plant health, and environmental conditions can influence the actual impact of Grape Colaspis on the crops. Regular scouting and monitoring of fields are crucial for making informed decisions about when to take action against this pest. Consulting with local extension services or agricultural professionals can provide more specific guidance tailored to your region and farming practices.
