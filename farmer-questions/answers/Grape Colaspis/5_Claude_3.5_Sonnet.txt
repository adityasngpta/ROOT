The economic thresholds for Grape Colaspis (Colaspis brunnea) in corn and soybean can vary depending on the crop stage and environmental conditions. For corn, the economic threshold is generally considered to be around 2-3 larvae per plant during the early vegetative stages. This threshold may be lower if the plants are under additional stress from factors like drought or poor soil conditions. In soybeans, the economic threshold is typically higher, with approximately 5-7 larvae per plant being the point at which treatment is recommended. However, it's important to note that these thresholds are not fixed and can change based on factors such as crop value, cost of control measures, and expected yield. Regular scouting and monitoring of fields is crucial to accurately assess Grape Colaspis populations and make informed decisions about pest management strategies. If populations approach or exceed these thresholds, farmers should consider implementing control measures to prevent significant yield losses.
