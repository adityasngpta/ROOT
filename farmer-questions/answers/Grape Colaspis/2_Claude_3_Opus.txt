Grape Colaspis (Colaspis brunnea) larvae can cause significant damage to soybean roots, especially in the early stages of plant growth. These small, white, C-shaped grubs feed on the roots and root hairs of soybean plants, leading to reduced nutrient and water uptake. The damage caused by Grape Colaspis larvae can result in stunted growth, yellowing of leaves, and wilting of the plants, particularly during dry conditions. In severe infestations, the larvae can cause substantial root pruning, making the plants more susceptible to lodging and reducing their ability to withstand drought stress. The damage may appear patchy within a field, as the larvae tend to concentrate in certain areas. Soybean plants are most vulnerable to Grape Colaspis damage during the seedling stage, and heavy infestations can lead to significant stand reduction and yield loss if left unmanaged.
