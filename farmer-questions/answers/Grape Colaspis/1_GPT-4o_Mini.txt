To identify Grape Colaspis larvae in corn fields, look for small, pale yellow to greenish larvae that are about 1 inch long when fully grown. They typically have a smooth, elongated body and may exhibit a slight curl when disturbed. Check for signs of feeding damage, which includes irregular holes in the leaves, particularly on younger plants. The larvae are often found near the base of the plant or in the soil, so carefully inspect the root zone and surrounding soil for their presence. Additionally, you may notice frass (larval excrement) near feeding sites. Monitoring for these signs, especially during the early growth stages of corn, will help you manage any potential infestations effectively. If you confirm their presence, consider implementing integrated pest management strategies, such as crop rotation or biological control, to mitigate their impact.
