The economic thresholds for Grape Colaspis in corn and soybeans vary depending on several factors including the growth stage of the crop, market prices, and the cost of control measures. For corn, the economic threshold is generally set at about 3 larvae per square foot before the V6 stage (six-leaf stage). This is because Grape Colaspis larvae feed on the roots, which can significantly impact young plants more than older, more established ones. In soybeans, the economic threshold is less clearly defined due to the variability in damage and the resilience of the crop. However, scouting for larvae and assessing root damage early in the season is crucial. If noticeable feeding damage is observed along with a presence of larvae, management actions should be considered, especially if the infestation levels are consistent across the field and the cost of treatment is justified by the potential yield loss. Always consider integrating pest management strategies and consult local extension services for the most accurate and region-specific advice.
