Grape Colaspis beetles, also known as "grape rootworms," can cause significant damage to grapevines. While they feed on both roots and leaves, the damage to the leaves is more readily visible and serves as a key indicator of infestation. You'll notice small, irregular holes in the leaves, often along the leaf margins and veins. These holes are created by the beetles feeding on the leaf tissue. Additionally, you may observe tiny, black specks on the underside of the leaves. These specks are the beetle's fecal matter, another telltale sign of their presence.  Furthermore, if you inspect the leaves closely, you might find small, yellowish-brown, comma-shaped grubs with six legs. These are the larvae of the grape Colaspis beetles. They are primarily found within the soil, feeding on roots, and their presence indicates a potential infestation. However, as their feeding activity occurs underground, it's not always easy to detect their presence solely by examining the leaves. Therefore, observing these signs on the leaves, coupled with monitoring the soil for larvae, can help you identify a grape Colaspis infestation early on. Early detection is crucial for effective management, preventing significant damage to your vines.
