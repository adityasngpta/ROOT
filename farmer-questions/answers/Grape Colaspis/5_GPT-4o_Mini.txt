The economic threshold for Grape Colaspis in corn is typically around 5 to 10 larvae per plant, depending on the growth stage of the corn and the overall health of the plants. For soybeans, the threshold is generally considered to be around 2 to 3 larvae per plant. It's important to monitor the population closely, as these thresholds can vary based on factors such as plant vigor, environmental conditions, and the presence of beneficial insects. If populations exceed these thresholds, consider implementing integrated pest management strategies, including cultural practices, biological controls, or targeted insecticide applications, to mitigate damage and protect your crops effectively. Regular scouting and timely interventions are key to managing Grape Colaspis and minimizing economic losses.
