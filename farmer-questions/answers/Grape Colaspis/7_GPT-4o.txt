Grape Colaspis, also known as Colaspis brunnea, primarily affects grapevines by feeding on the roots and foliage. The signs of damage include stunted growth and yellowing of the leaves, which can be mistaken for nutrient deficiencies. The larvae, which are small, white grubs, feed on the roots, causing the plants to weaken and become more susceptible to other stresses. Above ground, adult beetles chew on the leaves, creating irregular holes and notches along the edges. This foliar damage can reduce photosynthetic efficiency and overall plant vigor. In severe infestations, the combined root and foliar damage can lead to significant yield losses. Monitoring for these signs and implementing integrated pest management strategies, such as crop rotation and the use of insecticides when necessary, can help manage Grape Colaspis populations effectively.
