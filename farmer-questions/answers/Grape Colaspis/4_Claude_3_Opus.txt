Neonicotinoid seed treatments can provide some protection against Grape Colaspis (Colaspis brunnea), a leaf beetle whose larvae feed on the roots of various crops, including soybeans and corn. These systemic insecticides are absorbed by the plant and can help control early-season feeding damage from Grape Colaspis larvae. However, the effectiveness of neonicotinoid seed treatments against this pest can vary depending on factors such as the specific active ingredient, application rate, soil conditions, and pest pressure.

In some cases, neonicotinoid seed treatments may not provide complete control of Grape Colaspis, especially under high pest pressure or when environmental conditions favor the pest's development. Additionally, the use of neonicotinoids has come under scrutiny due to potential risks to pollinators and other non-target organisms. Therefore, it is essential to consider an integrated pest management (IPM) approach that incorporates multiple tactics, such as crop rotation, proper planting time, and scouting for damage, in addition to the judicious use of seed treatments when necessary. Consulting with local extension agents or crop advisors can help farmers make informed decisions about the most appropriate management strategies for Grape Colaspis in their specific situation.
