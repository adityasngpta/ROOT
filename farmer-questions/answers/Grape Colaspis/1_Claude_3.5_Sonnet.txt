To identify Grape Colaspis larvae in corn fields, look for small, white, C-shaped grubs with a distinct brown head capsule. These larvae are typically about 1/8 to 1/6 inch long when fully grown. They can be found in the soil around corn roots, often in the top 2-4 inches of soil. The larvae have three pairs of legs near the head and can be distinguished from other common corn pests by their smaller size and more slender body compared to white grubs or rootworm larvae. Grape Colaspis larvae are most active in the spring and early summer, so scouting during this time is crucial. When examining corn plants, look for signs of stunted growth, yellowing leaves, or wilting, as these may indicate root damage from Grape Colaspis feeding. To confirm their presence, carefully dig up affected plants and gently wash the soil from the roots to expose any larvae. Keep in mind that Grape Colaspis damage can sometimes be mistaken for other issues, so a thorough inspection is necessary for accurate identification.
