To identify Grape Colaspis larvae in corn fields, you should look for small, white to cream-colored grubs that are about 1/8 to 1/4 inch long. These larvae have a distinct C-shaped body and a brown head capsule. They are typically found in the soil, feeding on the roots of corn plants. Infested plants may exhibit symptoms such as stunted growth, yellowing leaves, and reduced vigor due to root damage. To confirm their presence, carefully dig around the base of affected plants and sift through the soil to locate the larvae. Regular scouting and monitoring of your fields, especially during the early stages of plant growth, can help in early detection and management of Grape Colaspis larvae.
