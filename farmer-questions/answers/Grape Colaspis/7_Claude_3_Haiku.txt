Grape Colaspis, also known as the grape rootworm, is a common pest that can cause significant damage to grapevines. The signs of Grape Colaspis damage in grapevines include wilting or stunted growth of the vines, yellowing or reddening of the leaves, and reduced fruit production. The adult beetles feed on the leaves, creating distinctive notches or holes, while the larvae feed on the roots, disrupting the plant's ability to take up water and nutrients. Severely infested vines may exhibit dieback of the shoots and canes, and the roots may appear discolored or have a "pruned" appearance. Farmers should regularly inspect their vineyards for these symptoms and take appropriate action to manage the pest population before it causes significant economic damage to their crop.
