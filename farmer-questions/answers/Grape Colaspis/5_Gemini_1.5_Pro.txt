Determining definitive economic thresholds for Grape Colaspis in corn and soybean is difficult and a "one-size-fits-all" approach isn't recommended.  Several factors influence the economic impact and subsequent management decisions, including planting date, plant population, soil type and moisture, and the presence of alternative food sources.  Generally, Grape Colaspis larvae are considered more damaging than adults.  In corn, damage from larval feeding on roots can stunt growth and reduce yield, particularly in lighter soils and early plantings.  Thresholds are often based on larval counts per square foot and can vary from 2 to 5 or more depending on the factors mentioned earlier.  In soybeans, the presence of alternative hosts like weed species can significantly influence the impact on the crop. Additionally, soybeans generally tolerate larval feeding better than corn.  Scouting and monitoring for both adults and larvae are crucial. Consider factors like growth stage, overall plant health, and environmental conditions when assessing potential damage and making management decisions in conjunction with your local extension service recommendations.
