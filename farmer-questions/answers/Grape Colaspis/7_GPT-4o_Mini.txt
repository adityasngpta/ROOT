Grape Colaspis damage in grapevines can be identified by several key signs. Look for irregular holes or notches on the edges of the leaves, which are caused by the larvae feeding on the foliage. Additionally, you may notice wilting or yellowing of the leaves, particularly in younger plants, as the larvae can severely weaken them. In some cases, you might find frass (insect excrement) on the leaves or around the base of the vines, indicating active feeding. If the infestation is severe, you may also observe stunted growth or dieback in the affected vines. Regular monitoring and early detection are crucial, so inspect your grapevines frequently, especially during the growing season, to manage any potential infestations effectively.
