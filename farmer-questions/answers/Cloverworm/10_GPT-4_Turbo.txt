Yes, intercropping can be an effective strategy to manage cloverworm populations in your fields. Intercropping, the practice of growing two or more crops in proximity, can enhance the biodiversity of an area and disrupt the habitat preferences of pests like cloverworms. By planting a diversity of crops, you create a less favorable environment for cloverworms, as they may find it more difficult to locate their preferred host plants. Additionally, certain crops can act as trap crops or provide habitat for natural enemies of cloverworms, further helping to control their numbers. For example, including flowering plants can attract beneficial insects that prey on cloverworms. It's important to choose companion crops that are compatible with your main crop and consider the overall agronomic conditions and goals of your farming operation.
