Cloverworms are a common pest of legumes, and their damage can be significant if left unchecked. The most obvious sign of Cloverworm damage is **leaf feeding**. You'll notice **irregular holes** in the leaves, often starting from the edges and working inwards.  Look for **tiny, green caterpillars** feeding on the leaves or hiding under them. These caterpillars can grow to be about an inch long and have a distinctive **dark head capsule**.  While the leaves are the primary target, they can also damage **buds, flowers, and pods**. This can result in **reduced seed yields and quality**.  Furthermore, you might find **frass** (caterpillar droppings) on the leaves and near the damaged areas.  If you notice any of these signs, take immediate action to control the infestation and protect your legume crop.
