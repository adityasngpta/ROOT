The Cloverworm, *Hypena scabra*, has a complete metamorphosis life cycle consisting of four stages: egg, larva, pupa, and adult. Adult moths lay eggs on the undersides of clover leaves. Upon hatching, the larvae feed on clover foliage, often causing significant damage. The larvae go through several instars (growth stages), molting as they grow larger. After reaching maturity, they pupate within silken cocoons spun in sheltered locations, such as under leaves or debris. Adult moths emerge from the pupae and the cycle repeats.  Understanding this life cycle is crucial for effective control measures. Targeting control efforts at specific stages, such as during the larval stage when they are actively feeding, can be most effective. For instance, insecticide applications should coincide with peak larval activity to maximize their impact.  Monitoring for egg masses and early instar larvae can help farmers implement timely control measures before significant damage occurs.  Furthermore, cultural practices like crop rotation can help disrupt the life cycle and minimize infestations.
