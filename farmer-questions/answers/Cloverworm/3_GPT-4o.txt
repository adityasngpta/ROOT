The Cloverworm (Hypena scabra) undergoes a complete metamorphosis with four distinct life stages: egg, larva, pupa, and adult. The adult moths lay eggs on the underside of leaves, which hatch into larvae within a few days. The larval stage, which is the most damaging, lasts for about 2-3 weeks. During this time, the larvae feed voraciously on the foliage of clover and other leguminous plants, causing significant defoliation. After the larval stage, the caterpillars pupate in the soil or leaf litter, emerging as adult moths after about 1-2 weeks. There can be multiple generations per year, especially in warmer climates.

Understanding the life cycle of the Cloverworm is crucial for effective control measures. Targeting the larvae when they are young and more susceptible to insecticides can significantly reduce their population. Monitoring for adult moths using pheromone traps can help predict larval outbreaks and time interventions more effectively. Cultural practices such as crop rotation and maintaining field hygiene by removing plant debris can disrupt the life cycle and reduce overwintering sites. Biological control agents, like parasitic wasps and predatory insects, can also be introduced to naturally manage Cloverworm populations. By integrating these strategies, farmers can achieve more sustainable and effective pest control.
