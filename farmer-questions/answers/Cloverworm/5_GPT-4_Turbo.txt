For managing cloverworms, particularly in soybean crops, biological control methods can be highly effective and environmentally sustainable. One of the most effective natural enemies of cloverworms is the parasitic wasp, which lays its eggs in or on the larvae, eventually controlling the population as the wasp larvae consume the host. Additionally, entomopathogenic fungi like Beauveria bassiana and Metarhizium anisopliae have shown effectiveness in infecting and killing cloverworm larvae. These fungi can be applied as biopesticides in areas where cloverworms are problematic. Another biological control includes the use of Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt), a bacterium that produces toxins harmful to cloverworms but safe for most other organisms. Bt can be applied as a foliar spray and is particularly useful in organic farming. Encouraging or introducing natural predators such as lady beetles and lacewings can also help reduce cloverworm populations as these predators feed on the eggs and young larvae. Combining these methods can provide a comprehensive approach to managing cloverworm infestations effectively while minimizing the impact on beneficial insects and the environment.
