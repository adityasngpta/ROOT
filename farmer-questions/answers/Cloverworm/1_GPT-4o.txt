To identify Cloverworm larvae in your alfalfa fields, look for small, green caterpillars that are about 1/2 inch long when fully grown. These larvae have a light green body with white stripes running lengthwise along their sides. They are often found feeding on the underside of leaves, creating small, irregular holes. You might also notice that the larvae tend to curl up into a C-shape when disturbed. Additionally, check for the presence of webbing on the leaves, as Cloverworm larvae often produce silk threads. Regular scouting of your fields, especially during the growing season, can help you detect these pests early and take appropriate management actions.
