Cloverworm damage in legumes is characterized by several distinct signs. Farmers should look for irregular holes in the leaves, which are often the result of the larvae feeding on the foliage. Additionally, you may notice frass (excrement) on the leaves or the ground beneath the plants, indicating the presence of the larvae. In severe cases, the plants may exhibit stunted growth or a general decline in vigor due to defoliation. If you observe these symptoms, itâ€™s crucial to monitor the population of cloverworms and consider implementing control measures, such as introducing beneficial insects, using insecticidal soaps, or applying targeted insecticides if necessary, to mitigate the damage and protect your legume crops.
