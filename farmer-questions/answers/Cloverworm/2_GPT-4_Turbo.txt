Cloverworms, particularly the green cloverworm (Hypena scabra), can cause significant damage to soybean plants primarily through defoliation. These larvae feed on the leaves, creating a "windowpane" effect initially by eating only the leaf tissue and leaving the veins intact. As they mature, their feeding can lead to more extensive defoliation, sometimes stripping plants almost entirely of their leaves if infestations are severe. This loss of leaf area can significantly reduce the plant's ability to photosynthesize, ultimately impacting the yield and quality of the soybean crop. Younger plants are more vulnerable and can be severely set back by heavy feeding, while older plants may tolerate more defoliation before yield loss occurs. However, it's crucial to monitor cloverworm populations and their impact closely to determine if and when management actions might be necessary to protect the crop effectively.
