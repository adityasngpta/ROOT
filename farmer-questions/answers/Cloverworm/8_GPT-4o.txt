Weather conditions significantly influence Cloverworm activity and the extent of damage they cause. Cloverworms thrive in warm, humid environments, which accelerate their life cycle and increase their feeding activity. During periods of mild temperatures and high humidity, Cloverworm populations can rapidly expand, leading to more severe infestations and greater damage to crops. Conversely, extreme temperatures, either too hot or too cold, can suppress their activity and reduce their numbers. Additionally, heavy rainfall can wash away larvae and eggs, thereby decreasing their population. Monitoring weather patterns can help farmers anticipate Cloverworm outbreaks and implement timely pest management strategies to mitigate damage.
