Biological control for Cloverworms involves introducing natural predators and parasites that target them. Some effective options include:

* **Beneficial Insects:**  Predatory insects like ladybugs, lacewings, and parasitic wasps prey on Cloverworm eggs and larvae. Introducing these insects into your fields can help control populations naturally. You can attract them by planting flowering plants that provide nectar and pollen, creating a habitat for them to thrive. 
* **Nematodes:** Certain parasitic nematodes target Cloverworm larvae, attacking them and causing their demise. Applying these nematodes to the soil can be an effective way to control the pest.
* **Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt):** This bacterium produces a toxin that is lethal to Cloverworm larvae. It can be applied as a spray to your clover fields, providing a safe and effective method of controlling the pest. 

Remember, these methods are most effective when used in a combined approach, creating a complex ecosystem where Cloverworms are less likely to thrive.
