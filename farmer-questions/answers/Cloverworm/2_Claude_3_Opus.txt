Cloverworms, the larval stage of certain moth species, can cause significant damage to soybean plants. These pests primarily feed on the leaves of soybean plants, creating irregular holes and skeletonizing the foliage. In severe infestations, cloverworms can completely defoliate soybean plants, reducing the plant's ability to photosynthesize and ultimately impacting yield potential. Young soybean plants are particularly vulnerable to cloverworm damage, as they have less foliage to spare and may struggle to recover from extensive defoliation. In addition to direct leaf damage, cloverworms can also feed on the pods and developing seeds, further compromising crop quality and yield. Monitoring soybean fields for signs of cloverworm activity, such as leaf damage and the presence of larvae, is crucial for timely management decisions to minimize crop losses.
