When it comes to managing Cloverworm infestations, it's important to establish appropriate economic thresholds to guide your decision-making process. Economic thresholds represent the pest population level at which the cost of control measures is justified by the potential yield loss. For Cloverworm, the economic threshold can vary depending on factors such as the crop, growth stage, and market prices. 

For alfalfa, the economic threshold is generally considered to be 3-5 Cloverworms per square foot during the vegetative growth stages, and 1-2 Cloverworms per square foot during the flowering and seed production stages. This is because Cloverworms can cause significant damage to the foliage and reduce the quality and yield of the crop. 

For other legume crops like clover, the economic threshold may be slightly higher, around 5-8 Cloverworms per square foot, as these crops can generally tolerate higher pest pressure without significant yield loss.

It's important to regularly monitor your fields and assess the Cloverworm population levels to determine if control measures are necessary. This may involve using sweep nets or visual inspections to estimate the number of Cloverworms present. By establishing and adhering to these economic thresholds, you can make informed decisions about when to implement control strategies, such as the application of insecticides or the use of cultural practices, to effectively manage Cloverworm infestations and maintain the profitability of your farming operation.
