The Cloverworm (Hypena scabra) is a moth species whose larvae can cause significant damage to soybean crops. The life cycle of the Cloverworm consists of four stages: egg, larva, pupa, and adult. Adult moths lay eggs on the undersides of soybean leaves, which hatch into larvae after about 3-5 days. The larvae feed on soybean foliage for approximately 14-20 days, going through 5-6 instars before pupating in the soil or leaf litter. The pupal stage lasts about 7-10 days, after which the adult moth emerges. The entire life cycle takes around 30-40 days, and there can be multiple generations per growing season depending on the climate.

Understanding the Cloverworm's life cycle is crucial for implementing effective control measures. Scouting for eggs and early-stage larvae can help detect infestations early, allowing for timely management decisions. Insecticide applications are most effective when targeted at young larvae, as older larvae are more difficult to control. Timing treatments to coincide with peak egg hatch and early larval stages can maximize efficacy. Additionally, cultural practices such as crop rotation and maintaining field hygiene can help reduce Cloverworm populations by breaking their life cycle and minimizing overwintering sites. Regularly monitoring soybean fields, especially during the reproductive stages when defoliation can have the greatest impact on yield, is essential for making informed management decisions based on economic thresholds.
