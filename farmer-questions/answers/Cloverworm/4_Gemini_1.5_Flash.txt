Unfortunately, there are no pheromone traps specifically designed for monitoring Cloverworm populations. Cloverworms (**Hypera postica**) are a type of weevil, and while pheromone traps are effective for managing other weevil species, they have not been developed for Cloverworm control.  The primary reason for this is that Cloverworm pheromones have not been adequately identified and synthesized for use in traps. Instead of relying on pheromone traps, you can monitor Cloverworm populations by visually inspecting your clover fields, particularly during the larval stage when they are most damaging. Look for signs of feeding damage, such as holes in leaves and defoliation. Additionally, consider using other integrated pest management (IPM) techniques like beneficial insects, crop rotation, and targeted insecticide applications to manage Cloverworm populations.
