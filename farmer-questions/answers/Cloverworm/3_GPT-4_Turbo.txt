The cloverworm, specifically the green cloverworm (Hypsopygia costalis), undergoes a typical moth lifecycle, consisting of four stages: egg, larva (caterpillar), pupa, and adult. The eggs are laid on the host plants and hatch into larvae, which are the primary feeding stage damaging the crops. These larvae go through several instars, growing larger with each stage, before pupating. The pupa stage occurs in the soil or in leaf litter near the host plants. Adults emerge from the pupae, mate, and lay eggs to continue the cycle. This cycle can occur multiple times per year, especially in warmer climates.

Understanding this lifecycle is crucial for effective control measures. For instance, targeting the larval stage, which is the most damaging to crops, can be done through timely application of insecticides or introduction of natural predators. Monitoring for adult moths can also provide a warning for imminent egg laying and larval activity. Cultural practices such as crop rotation and removing plant residues can help disrupt the lifecycle by eliminating sites for pupation and overwintering. Thus, timing control methods to target specific lifecycle stages when the cloverworms are most vulnerable can enhance control efficacy and potentially reduce the need for chemical interventions.
