Yes, there are pheromone traps available for monitoring Cloverworm (Hypena scabra) populations in agricultural settings. Cloverworms are a common pest that can damage a variety of crops, including alfalfa, clover, and other legumes. Pheromone traps utilize the female Cloverworm's sex pheromone to attract and capture male moths, allowing farmers to monitor the pest's population levels and time management strategies accordingly. These traps provide an effective, non-toxic method for tracking Cloverworm activity and can help inform integrated pest management (IPM) decisions, such as when to apply targeted insecticide treatments or employ other control measures. Consulting with your local agricultural extension office or pest management supplier can help you identify the appropriate pheromone lures and traps for your specific crop and region. Utilizing pheromone monitoring is a valuable tool for sustainable Cloverworm management.
