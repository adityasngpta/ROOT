Cloverworm damage in legumes can be identified by several distinct signs. The most obvious indicator is the presence of holes or irregular patches of feeding damage on the leaves, as the larvae of cloverworms voraciously consume foliage. In severe infestations, entire leaves may be skeletonized, leaving only the veins intact. Additionally, you might observe the presence of dark green, cylindrical larvae on the undersides of leaves or on the stems. These larvae, measuring about an inch long, are the immature stage of the cloverworm moth. Silk webbing may also be visible on the plants, as the larvae tend to create shelters by webbing leaves together. In some cases, you may notice a decrease in the overall vigor and growth of the legume plants due to the extensive defoliation caused by the cloverworms. Regularly scouting your fields and inspecting the plants for these signs can help you detect and manage cloverworm infestations early, minimizing the potential damage to your legume crops.
