The economic threshold for managing cloverworms in soybeans, which is one of the common crops affected by this pest, generally depends on the growth stage of the crop and the intensity of the infestation. Typically, an economic threshold is reached when there are about 10 to 15 larvae per row-foot in the vegetative stage, or 8 larvae per row-foot during the reproductive stages of the plant. It's important to also consider the overall health of the crop, the potential for regrowth, and prevailing weather conditions which might affect both the pest and the crop. Regular scouting should be conducted to monitor cloverworm populations effectively. If the number of larvae exceeds these thresholds, it may be economically justifiable to apply appropriate insecticidal treatments to prevent significant damage to the crop and yield losses. Always consider integrated pest management practices, including the use of biological controls and resistant varieties, to manage cloverworm populations sustainably.
