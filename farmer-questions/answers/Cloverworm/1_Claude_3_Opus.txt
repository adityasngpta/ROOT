To identify Cloverworm larvae in your alfalfa fields, look for pale green caterpillars with white stripes running along their sides. These larvae are typically about 1 to 1.5 inches long when fully grown. They can be found feeding on the leaves of alfalfa plants, causing irregular holes or skeletonization of the foliage. Cloverworm larvae are most active during the day and tend to hide under debris or in the soil at night. Scouting for these pests should be done by thoroughly inspecting the alfalfa plants, paying close attention to the undersides of leaves where the larvae often feed. If you notice significant damage to the foliage along with the presence of pale green caterpillars, it is likely that you have a Cloverworm infestation in your alfalfa fields. Proper identification is crucial for implementing the most effective management strategies to control the pest population and minimize crop damage.
