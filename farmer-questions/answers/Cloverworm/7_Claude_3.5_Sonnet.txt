When considering economic thresholds for Cloverworm management, it's important to note that these can vary depending on the crop stage and local conditions. Generally, for soybeans, which are commonly affected by Cloverworms, the economic threshold is typically reached when there are 4 to 7 Cloverworms per foot of row, or when 20-30% defoliation is observed during pod-fill stages. For earlier vegetative stages, the threshold may be higher, around 30-40% defoliation, as plants can better compensate for leaf loss at this stage. It's crucial to scout your fields regularly, especially during the reproductive stages of the crop, to accurately assess Cloverworm populations and damage levels. Remember that these thresholds are guidelines, and factors such as crop value, control costs, and environmental conditions should also be considered when making management decisions. If you're dealing with a different crop or have specific local recommendations, it's advisable to consult with your local agricultural extension service for more precise thresholds tailored to your situation.
