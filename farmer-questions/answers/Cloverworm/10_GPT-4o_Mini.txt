Yes, intercropping can be an effective strategy to manage Cloverworm populations. By planting a diverse range of crops alongside your primary crop, you can disrupt the life cycle of Cloverworms and reduce their populations. For instance, incorporating plants that are less attractive to Cloverworms or that attract beneficial insects, such as parasitoids and predators, can help keep their numbers in check. Additionally, intercropping can enhance soil health and improve overall crop resilience, making your farm more sustainable. However, it's important to choose compatible crops and monitor the pest populations regularly to assess the effectiveness of this approach.
