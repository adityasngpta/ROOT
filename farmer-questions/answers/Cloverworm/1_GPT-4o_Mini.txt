To identify Cloverworm larvae in your alfalfa fields, look for small, green caterpillars that are typically about 1 to 1.5 inches long. They have a distinctive light green color with a faint stripe running down their sides, and they may have a velvety appearance. Check the undersides of leaves, as these larvae tend to feed there, causing notching or irregular holes in the foliage. Additionally, you might notice frass (caterpillar droppings) on the leaves or the ground beneath the plants. Monitoring for these signs, especially during the early growth stages of alfalfa, will help you catch infestations early. If you find significant damage or a high number of larvae, consider implementing integrated pest management strategies, such as introducing natural predators or applying targeted insecticides, to control their population effectively.
