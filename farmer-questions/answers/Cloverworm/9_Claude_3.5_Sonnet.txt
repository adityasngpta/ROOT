Cloverworm damage in legumes typically manifests as distinctive feeding patterns on the leaves. The most noticeable sign is irregular holes chewed in the foliage, often leaving a lacy or skeletonized appearance. These caterpillars tend to feed from the outer edges of the leaves inward, creating a ragged outline. In severe infestations, you may observe significant defoliation, with entire leaves being consumed except for the main veins. Cloverworms are also known to feed on pods in some legume crops, causing direct yield loss. Additionally, you might spot the green caterpillars themselves on the undersides of leaves or clinging to stems. Their presence is often accompanied by small black fecal pellets on the leaves or on the ground beneath the plants. Early detection of these signs is crucial for implementing timely control measures and preventing extensive crop damage.
