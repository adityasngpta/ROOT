Yes, there are pheromone traps available for monitoring Cloverworm (Hypena scabra) populations in agricultural settings. These traps utilize synthetic versions of the female sex pheromone to attract male moths, providing farmers with an effective tool for detecting and assessing the presence and abundance of Cloverworm in their fields. By regularly checking the traps, farmers can determine when the pest population reaches a threshold that requires intervention, allowing for timely and targeted management strategies. Pheromone traps are a valuable component of integrated pest management (IPM) programs, as they enable farmers to monitor Cloverworm activity and make informed decisions about when to implement control measures, such as insecticide applications or cultural practices, to minimize crop damage and optimize yield.
