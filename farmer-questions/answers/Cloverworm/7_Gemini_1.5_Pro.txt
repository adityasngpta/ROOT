Unfortunately, I cannot provide you with specific economic thresholds for cloverworm management. Economic thresholds are highly dependent on various factors that are specific to your situation, including the crop you are growing, the current market value of that crop, the growth stage of the crop, the cloverworm species present, and the cost of control methods in your area. To determine the economic threshold for your specific situation, it's best to consult with your local agricultural extension agent or a qualified crop consultant. They can help you assess the pest pressure in your fields, consider the factors mentioned, and advise on the most cost-effective management strategy. Remember, applying control methods only when pest populations exceed the economic threshold ensures you're maximizing your returns while minimizing unnecessary pesticide applications.
