For controlling cloverworms, several effective biological control methods can be employed. One of the most successful approaches is the use of parasitic wasps, particularly species from the genera Cotesia and Microplitis. These wasps lay their eggs inside cloverworm larvae, and when the eggs hatch, the wasp larvae feed on the cloverworm from the inside, eventually killing it. Another effective method is the application of Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt), a naturally occurring soil bacterium that produces proteins toxic to cloverworms when ingested. Bt is safe for humans and other non-target organisms, making it an excellent choice for organic farming. Additionally, encouraging natural predators such as birds, ground beetles, and spiders can help keep cloverworm populations in check. Planting nectar-rich flowers near crop fields can attract these beneficial insects and provide them with alternative food sources. Lastly, the use of entomopathogenic nematodes, particularly species like Steinernema carpocapsae, can be effective in controlling cloverworms in the soil. These microscopic worms infect and kill the pest larvae, providing long-term suppression of cloverworm populations.
