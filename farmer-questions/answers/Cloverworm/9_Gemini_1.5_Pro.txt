Cloverworms can be quite destructive to legume fields, and identifying their presence early is crucial for effective management.  Initially, you'll notice small holes or notches on the leaves, a telltale sign of their feeding activity. As these caterpillars grow, the damage intensifies, leading to significant defoliation.  You might observe skeletonized leaves where only the veins remain, giving the field a lacy appearance.  In severe infestations, entire plants may be consumed, leading to reduced yield and overall crop health.  Keep a close eye out for their tiny, pellet-like excrement, also known as frass, on the leaves and around the base of the plants, which is another indicator of their presence.  Regularly scouting your legume fields, especially during the evening or night when cloverworms are most active, will help you identify these signs early on.
