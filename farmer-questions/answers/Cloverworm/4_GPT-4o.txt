Yes, pheromone traps are available for monitoring Cloverworm (Hypera punctata) populations. These traps use synthetic pheromones that mimic the natural sex pheromones of the female Cloverworm to attract male moths. By capturing the males, farmers can monitor the population levels and activity periods of the pest. This information is crucial for making informed decisions about the timing and necessity of control measures. Regular monitoring with pheromone traps can help in early detection and in implementing integrated pest management (IPM) strategies, thereby reducing the reliance on chemical pesticides and promoting sustainable farming practices.
