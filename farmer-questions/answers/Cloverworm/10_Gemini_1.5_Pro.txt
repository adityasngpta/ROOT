Intercropping can be a helpful tool in managing cloverworm populations, but it's not a standalone solution.  Cloverworms are primarily attracted to legumes like alfalfa and clover.  Intercropping these with non-host crops like grasses or small grains can make it harder for the pests to find and infest their preferred food source. This strategy, combined with other Integrated Pest Management (IPM) practices, helps reduce cloverworm numbers. For instance, regular monitoring allows you to identify infestations early on. This early detection allows you to take timely action, such as releasing natural predators of cloverworms like parasitic wasps or, if necessary, applying a targeted insecticide. Remember, the success of intercropping in managing cloverworms depends on factors like the specific crops used, local climate, and the presence of other pest management practices.
