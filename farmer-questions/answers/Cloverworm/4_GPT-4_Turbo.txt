As of the last update, there are no commercially available pheromone traps specifically designed for monitoring cloverworm populations, particularly for the green cloverworm (Hypsopygia costalis) which is common in soybean crops. Pheromone traps are more commonly used for other types of pests such as moths and beetles. For managing cloverworms, farmers typically rely on regular field scouting to monitor larval populations and assess damage. Visual inspection of plants for signs of feeding, such as defoliation, is crucial. If cloverworm populations exceed economic threshold levels, appropriate insecticidal treatments may be necessary. It's also beneficial to consider integrated pest management (IPM) strategies, including the use of natural predators and crop rotation, to help control cloverworm and other pest populations sustainably.
