Identifying Cloverworm larvae in your alfalfa fields can be done by closely examining the plants for signs of their presence. These larvae are small, green caterpillars with black heads and a distinctive dark stripe down their back. They feed on alfalfa leaves, leaving behind characteristic holes and ragged edges. You can also look for webbing and frass (caterpillar droppings) on the leaves and stems. To effectively manage a Cloverworm infestation, monitor your fields regularly for signs of damage and consider using biological control methods like beneficial insects or Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) insecticide. However, if the infestation is severe, you might need to employ chemical control measures. Always consult a certified crop advisor or a local extension office to choose the most effective and safe control method for your specific situation.
