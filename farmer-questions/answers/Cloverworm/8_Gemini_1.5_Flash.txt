Cloverworm activity and damage are heavily influenced by weather conditions. Warm temperatures and high humidity promote rapid development and increase the likelihood of infestations. Optimal conditions for cloverworm activity occur when temperatures range from 70 to 80 degrees Fahrenheit and relative humidity is above 60%. These conditions accelerate the development of eggs and larvae, allowing them to complete their life cycle quickly and cause significant damage to crops. Conversely, cool temperatures and dry conditions slow down the cloverworm's development, reducing their activity and impact. Frequent rainfall can also wash away eggs and larvae, further minimizing their populations. However, excessive rainfall can lead to fungal diseases in cloverworms, potentially affecting their survival. Monitoring weather conditions and anticipating periods of favorable weather for cloverworm development is crucial for timely intervention and effective control measures.
