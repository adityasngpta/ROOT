Cloverworms, also known as green cloverworms, primarily cause damage to soybean plants by feeding on the foliage. These larvae chew irregular holes in the leaves, which can lead to significant defoliation if infestations are severe. While soybeans can tolerate some leaf loss without a substantial impact on yield, extensive defoliation during critical growth stages, such as flowering and pod development, can reduce photosynthetic capacity and ultimately lower yields. Additionally, heavy infestations can weaken plants, making them more susceptible to other stresses and diseases. Monitoring and timely intervention are crucial to managing cloverworm populations and minimizing their impact on soybean crops.
