Yes, intercropping can be an effective strategy to manage Cloverworm populations. By planting a diverse array of crops together, you can disrupt the habitat and feeding patterns of Cloverworms, making it more difficult for them to locate and infest their preferred host plants. For instance, incorporating crops that are not susceptible to Cloverworms can act as a physical barrier or distract the pests, reducing their impact on the primary crop. Additionally, intercropping can attract beneficial insects that prey on Cloverworms, further helping to keep their populations in check. It's important to select companion crops that are compatible with your main crop and local growing conditions to ensure the success of this integrated pest management approach.
