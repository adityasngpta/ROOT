Cloverworm infestations can be devastating to clover crops, impacting yield and quality. The key to prevention lies in integrated pest management practices that focus on proactive measures and minimizing favorable conditions for the pest.  Begin by choosing certified pest-free seed and resistant clover varieties whenever available. Implement crop rotation strategies, avoiding consecutive clover plantings in the same field. This disrupts the pest's lifecycle and reduces their survival rate.  Regularly scout your fields, examining plant leaves, flowers, and stems for signs of cloverworm presence, such as eggs, larvae, or feeding damage. Encourage beneficial insects like parasitic wasps and predatory beetles that prey on cloverworms by planting companion plants and minimizing broad-spectrum insecticide use.  Maintain a healthy soil ecosystem to promote vigorous plant growth, making them more resilient to infestations. Finally, if scouting reveals an infestation exceeding the economic threshold, consider applying a targeted insecticide recommended by your local agricultural extension for effective control.
