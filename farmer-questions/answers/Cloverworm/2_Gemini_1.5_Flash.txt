Cloverworms, the larvae of the clover leaf weevil, are a significant pest of soybean plants, primarily feeding on foliage and causing various types of damage.  They typically attack young soybean plants, feeding on the leaves and stems, which can stunt their growth and reduce yield. Cloverworms create small, ragged holes in the leaves, leaving behind a skeletonized appearance. This feeding damage can significantly decrease photosynthesis, leading to weakened plants and reduced vigor. In severe infestations, they can completely defoliate plants, leaving them vulnerable to further stress. Additionally, they may damage the developing pods, leading to reduced seed set and quality. To prevent significant yield losses, monitoring for cloverworms and implementing control measures like insecticide applications or utilizing beneficial insects are crucial for soybean production.
