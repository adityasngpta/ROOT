Economic thresholds for Cloverworm management vary depending on the specific crop, its stage of growth, and the cost of control measures. However, a general guideline is to initiate control measures when you observe an average of 2-3 Cloverworms per 100 plants in the early vegetative stages of a crop like alfalfa. As the crop matures and approaches the flowering stage, this threshold may increase slightly to 3-4 worms per 100 plants. Remember that these thresholds are only guidelines and can be adjusted based on your specific situation and the potential impact of a Cloverworm infestation on your crop yield. Carefully scout your fields regularly to determine the Cloverworm population and consider factors like the current growth stage of your crop, the expected market price for your produce, and the cost of insecticide applications when deciding whether to apply control measures.
