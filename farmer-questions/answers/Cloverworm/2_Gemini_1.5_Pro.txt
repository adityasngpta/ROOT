Cloverworms are voracious defoliators that can significantly impact soybean yield, especially during the late vegetative and early reproductive stages. These small, pale green caterpillars primarily feed on the undersides of soybean leaves, creating a characteristic "windowpane" effect where they consume the leaf tissue between the veins. As infestations progress, cloverworms can skeletonize entire leaves, reducing the plant's photosynthetic capacity and ultimately impacting pod and seed development. In severe cases, this defoliation can lead to stunted growth, delayed maturity, and significant yield loss. Additionally, weakened plants become more susceptible to other stresses like diseases and drought, further compounding the damage caused by these pests.
