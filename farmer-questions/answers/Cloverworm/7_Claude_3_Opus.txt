When managing Cloverworm infestations in your crops, it's important to consider economic thresholds to determine if and when control measures are necessary. The economic threshold for Cloverworm varies depending on the crop and its growth stage. 

For soybeans, the economic threshold is reached when defoliation levels exceed 30% pre-bloom, 20% during blooming and pod-fill, and 35% from pod-fill to harvest. In peanuts, the threshold is 4 or more larvae per row foot. For alfalfa, consider taking action when 10% of plant terminals show feeding damage.

Regularly scout your fields to monitor Cloverworm populations and assess defoliation levels. If the economic threshold is met or exceeded, applying an appropriate insecticide can help protect yield. However, natural predators and parasites often keep Cloverworm populations in check. Only resort to insecticide applications when necessary to minimize negative impacts on beneficial insects and prevent unnecessary expenses. Consult your local cooperative extension office for more specific guidance tailored to your region and cropping system.
