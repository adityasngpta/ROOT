For effective management of cloverworms, the economic threshold typically depends on the growth stage of the crop and the potential yield loss. Generally, for soybean crops, the economic threshold is around 25% defoliation during the vegetative stages and 15% during the reproductive stages. In the case of alfalfa, action should be considered when cloverworm populations reach about 2 to 3 per sweep in a standard sweep net sampling. It's essential to monitor the population levels regularly and assess the overall health of the crop, as well as the potential yield loss, to make informed decisions about whether to implement control measures. Always consider integrating pest management strategies, including biological controls and cultural practices, to minimize reliance on chemical treatments and promote sustainable farming practices.
