Cloverworm larvae, a common alfalfa pest, are identifiable through careful observation.  Young larvae are small and translucent, approximately 1/16 inch long, with a distinctive pale yellow head. As they mature, they grow to about 1.5 inches, their bodies turning a pale green with a characteristic white stripe running down each side. A key identifying feature is their looping movement, similar to inchworms, as they crawl.  Look for these larvae on the leaves and near the top of the plants, particularly in the early morning or late evening when they are most active. Early detection is crucial for effective management, so be vigilant in scouting your fields regularly.
