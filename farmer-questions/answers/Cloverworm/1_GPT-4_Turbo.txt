Cloverworm larvae, also known as green cloverworms, can be identified in your alfalfa fields by their distinct physical characteristics and behavior. These larvae are typically light green with a slender body and have three pairs of prominent white stripes running lengthwise down their sides. They measure about 1 inch when fully grown. Cloverworm larvae possess three pairs of true legs near the head and three pairs of prolegs towards the rear, which gives them a characteristic looping or "inchworm" movement as they crawl. To confirm their presence, inspect the alfalfa plants for signs of feeding damage such as skeletonized leaves, where only the leaf veins remain. Young larvae chew small holes in the leaves, while older larvae can consume large areas of leaf tissue. Regular field scouting during the growing season, especially from mid-summer to early fall when these pests are most active, will help in timely identification and management.
