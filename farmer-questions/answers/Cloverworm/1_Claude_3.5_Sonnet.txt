To identify Cloverworm larvae in your alfalfa fields, look for slender, pale green caterpillars with thin white stripes running along their sides. These larvae typically grow to about 1 to 1.5 inches long when fully mature. They have three pairs of true legs near the head and three pairs of prolegs on their abdomen, with an additional pair at the rear end. Cloverworm larvae move with a distinctive looping motion, similar to inchworms. When disturbed, they often wriggle violently and may drop from the plant on a silken thread. You'll likely find them feeding on the undersides of alfalfa leaves, creating irregular holes in the foliage. To confirm their presence, conduct a sweep net sampling of your field, paying close attention to the edges where infestations often begin. Keep in mind that Cloverworm populations can increase rapidly, so regular monitoring is crucial for effective management.
