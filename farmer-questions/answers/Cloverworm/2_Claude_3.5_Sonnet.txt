Cloverworms, also known as green cloverworms, can cause significant damage to soybean plants. These pests primarily feed on the leaves of soybean plants, creating irregular holes and ragged edges. As they consume the foliage, they reduce the plant's photosynthetic capacity, which can lead to decreased yield if the infestation is severe. Cloverworms typically start feeding on the lower leaves of the plant and gradually move upward. In cases of heavy infestations, they may defoliate entire plants, leaving only the leaf veins and stems behind. This extensive leaf loss can result in stunted growth, reduced pod formation, and ultimately, lower soybean production. While soybeans can tolerate some defoliation without significant yield loss, severe or prolonged cloverworm feeding during critical growth stages, such as flowering and pod fill, can have a more substantial impact on crop productivity. Farmers should monitor their soybean fields regularly for signs of cloverworm activity and consider implementing control measures if the damage exceeds economic thresholds.
