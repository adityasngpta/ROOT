While pheromone traps are a valuable tool for monitoring many pest insects, there are currently **no commercially available pheromone traps specific to cloverworms**. This is because the pheromones used by cloverworms for mating haven't been fully identified and synthesized for use in traps.  Farmers often rely on visual scouting and sweep net sampling to monitor cloverworm populations in alfalfa fields.  Looking for eggs and larvae on plants, along with noting feeding damage, can help determine if treatment thresholds are met.  Additionally, monitoring for adult moths, though less reliable for timing applications, can provide some indication of pest pressure.
