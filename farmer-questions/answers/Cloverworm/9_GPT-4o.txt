Cloverworm damage in legumes is typically characterized by several distinct signs. You may notice irregular holes in the leaves, which are often the result of the larvae feeding on the foliage. The damage usually starts as small, round holes and can progress to larger, more irregularly shaped holes as the larvae grow. In severe infestations, the leaves may appear skeletonized, with only the veins remaining. Additionally, you might observe the presence of greenish larvae, which are about 1/2 inch long, on the undersides of the leaves. These larvae are often active during the day and can be seen moving around the plant. Another sign is the presence of frass, or insect excrement, which looks like small, dark pellets on the leaves or around the base of the plant. Monitoring for these signs early can help in managing and controlling Cloverworm populations before they cause significant damage to your legume crops.
