Cloverworm, primarily the larvae of the green cloverworm moth, can cause noticeable damage in legumes such as soybeans, alfalfa, and clovers. The signs of cloverworm damage typically include irregular, ragged holes in the leaves, as the larvae chew through the leaf tissue. Initially, the damage may appear as small pinholes which can expand significantly as the infestation progresses. In severe cases, the larvae can defoliate plants, leaving only the stems and large veins, which severely impacts the plant's ability to photosynthesize and grow. Additionally, you might observe the presence of small, slender green caterpillars on the plants, which is a direct indication of cloverworm presence. Monitoring these signs early can help in managing the infestation before it causes significant damage to the crop.
