Cloverworm larvae, also known as the alfalfa webworm, can be a significant pest in alfalfa fields. To identify them, look for small, green caterpillars with a distinct white stripe along each side of their body. They may also have a faint yellow or reddish-brown stripe down the center of their back. Cloverworm larvae typically measure around 1-1.5 inches in length when fully grown. They often feed on the leaves and stems of alfalfa plants, creating webbing and defoliation. To confirm their presence, inspect the alfalfa canopy, looking closely at the leaves and stems for the distinctive larvae. If you find evidence of their feeding damage, such as skeletonized leaves or webbing, that is a strong indication that cloverworms are present in your field. Monitoring your alfalfa regularly can help you identify and address cloverworm infestations early, allowing you to implement appropriate management strategies to protect your crop.
