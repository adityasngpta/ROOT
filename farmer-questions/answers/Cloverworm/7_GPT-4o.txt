For effective Cloverworm management, economic thresholds are crucial to determine when control measures should be implemented to prevent significant economic loss. Generally, the economic threshold for Cloverworms in crops like soybeans is around 20-30% defoliation before the flowering stage and 15-20% defoliation during the flowering and pod-filling stages. These thresholds are based on the understanding that soybeans can tolerate a certain level of defoliation without a significant impact on yield. Regular field scouting is essential to monitor Cloverworm populations and defoliation levels accurately. If the defoliation exceeds these thresholds, it is advisable to consider appropriate control measures such as insecticide application, ensuring that the chosen method is both effective and environmentally sustainable. Always consider integrating pest management strategies to reduce reliance on chemical controls and promote long-term crop health.
