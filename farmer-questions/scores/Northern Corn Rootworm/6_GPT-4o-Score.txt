1. Accuracy (2/2) [The answer provides accurate information about the economic threshold for Northern Corn Rootworm control, including the specific threshold range of 0.75 to 1 adult beetle per plant during peak emergence. The timing (late July to early August) and control measures mentioned are also correct.]

2. Comprehensiveness (2/2) [The response covers all key aspects of economic thresholds for NCR control, including the threshold itself, timing, monitoring methods, control measures, and the rationale behind using thresholds. It also mentions the importance of balancing costs with potential yield losses.]

3. Clarity (2/2) [The answer is well-structured, clear, and easy to understand. It presents information in a logical order, starting with the threshold, then explaining when and how to monitor, and finally discussing control measures.]

4. Actionability (2/2) [The response provides specific, actionable advice. It gives a clear threshold to watch for, explains when and how to monitor (using yellow sticky traps or visual inspections), and outlines control measures (crop rotation, insecticide-treated seeds, soil-applied insecticides) that can be implemented if the threshold is exceeded.]

5. Relevance (1/1) [The answer directly addresses the farmer's question about economic thresholds for Northern Corn Rootworm control, providing relevant and specific information.]

6. Miscellaneous (-0) [No points subtracted.]
