1. Accuracy (2/2) [The answer provides accurate information about the early signs of Northern Corn Rootworm infestation, including the appearance of adult beetles, feeding damage, and root damage. The description of the beetles and their impact on the corn plants is correct.]

2. Comprehensiveness (1/2) [The answer covers most aspects of the early signs, but it misses some important details. It doesn't mention the timing of larval damage, which typically occurs earlier in the season, or specific leaf symptoms like "goose-necking" that can result from root damage.]

3. Clarity (2/2) [The answer is well-structured, clear, and easy to understand. It presents information in a logical order, starting with visible signs and progressing to more hidden symptoms.]

4. Actionability (1/2) [The answer provides some actionable advice, such as monitoring for adult beetles and examining roots. However, it lacks specific guidance on when to start looking for these signs or how frequently to monitor.]

5. Relevance (1/1) [The answer is highly relevant to the farmer's question, directly addressing the early signs of Northern Corn Rootworm infestation in corn fields.]

6. Miscellaneous (-0) [No additional points subtracted.]
