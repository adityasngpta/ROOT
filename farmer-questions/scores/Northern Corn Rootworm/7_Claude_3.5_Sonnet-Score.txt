1. Accuracy (2/2) [The answer provides accurate information about crop rotation's impact on Northern Corn Rootworm populations, including the pest's life cycle, the effect of rotation on larvae, and the adaptation of extended diapause in some populations.]

2. Comprehensiveness (2/2) [The response covers all key aspects of the question, including how crop rotation works against the pest, its effectiveness, and potential limitations due to pest adaptation.]

3. Clarity (2/2) [The answer is well-structured, clear, and easy to understand, with a logical flow from explaining the pest's behavior to the effects of crop rotation and potential adaptations.]

4. Actionability (1/2) [While the answer explains the concept of crop rotation and its effects, it lacks specific, practical advice on implementation, such as recommended rotation cycles or alternative crops to use.]

5. Relevance (1/1) [The response directly addresses the farmer's question about the impact of crop rotation on Northern Corn Rootworm populations.]

6. Miscellaneous (-0) [No additional points subtracted.]
