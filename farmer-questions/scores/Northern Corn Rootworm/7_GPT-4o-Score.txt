1. Accuracy (2/2) [The answer provides accurate information about the impact of crop rotation on Northern Corn Rootworm populations. It correctly describes the pest's life cycle and how crop rotation disrupts it.]

2. Comprehensiveness (2/2) [The response thoroughly addresses the question, covering the mechanism of crop rotation's impact, its effects on the pest's life cycle, and the long-term benefits of this practice.]

3. Clarity (2/2) [The answer is well-structured, clear, and easy to understand. It logically explains the process and outcomes of crop rotation in relation to Northern Corn Rootworm populations.]

4. Actionability (1/2) [While the answer implies that crop rotation is an effective method, it doesn't provide specific, practical advice on how to implement crop rotation or which crops are best to use in rotation. It could be more actionable by including these details.]

5. Relevance (1/1) [The response is highly relevant to the farmer's question, directly addressing how crop rotation impacts Northern Corn Rootworm populations.]
