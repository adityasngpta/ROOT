1. Accuracy (2/2) [The answer provides accurate information about the best time to scout for Northern Corn Rootworms, correctly identifying late June to early July as the optimal period. The information about egg hatch, larval stages, and feeding habits is also accurate.]

2. Comprehensiveness (1/2) [The answer covers the main aspects of when to scout and why, but it misses some important details. It doesn't mention specific scouting techniques, such as digging up plants to examine roots or using sticky traps for adult beetles. It also doesn't address regional variations in timing or the importance of monitoring throughout the growing season.]

3. Clarity (2/2) [The answer is well-structured, clear, and easy to understand. It logically explains the timing, reasons for scouting during this period, and what to look for.]

4. Actionability (1/2) [The answer provides general advice on when to scout and what to look for, which is somewhat actionable. However, it lacks specific, practical details on how to conduct the scouting effectively or what thresholds might indicate the need for control measures.]

5. Relevance (1/1) [The answer is highly relevant to the farmer's question, directly addressing when to scout for Northern Corn Rootworms.]

6. Miscellaneous (-0) [No additional points subtracted.]
