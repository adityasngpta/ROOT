1. Accuracy (2/2) [The answer provides accurate information about the impact of crop rotation on Northern Corn Rootworm populations. It correctly states that crop rotation disrupts the pest's life cycle, reduces their numbers, and explains how non-host crops can starve the larvae and adults.]

2. Comprehensiveness (2/2) [The response thoroughly addresses the question, covering the main aspects of how crop rotation affects the pest population. It includes information on the pest's primary food source, the effect of rotating with non-host crops, and the broader benefits of crop rotation on soil health and ecosystem.]

3. Clarity (2/2) [The answer is well-structured, clear, and easy to understand. It presents information in a logical flow, starting with the direct impact on the pest and moving to broader agricultural benefits.]

4. Actionability (1/2) [While the answer provides general advice on crop rotation, it lacks specific, practical details such as recommended rotation cycles or examples of effective non-host crops beyond soybeans and small grains. More detailed actionable advice would have earned a full score.]

5. Relevance (1/1) [The response is highly relevant to the farmer's question, directly addressing how crop rotation impacts Northern Corn Rootworm populations.]

6. Miscellaneous (-0) [No additional points subtracted.]

Total Score: (8/9)
