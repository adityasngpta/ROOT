1. Accuracy (2/2) [The answer provides accurate information about grasshopper damage and its long-term impacts on crop yield. The description of feeding habits, effects on plant health, and potential for total crop loss are all correct. The information about increased susceptibility to diseases and pests, as well as the impact on soil nutrients, is also accurate.]

2. Comprehensiveness (2/2) [The response thoroughly addresses the long-term impacts of grasshopper damage, covering direct effects on plants, secondary effects on plant health, soil fertility implications, and economic consequences. It also mentions the need for management and control measures.]

3. Clarity (2/2) [The answer is well-structured, clear, and easy to understand. It progresses logically from immediate impacts to long-term consequences, using concise and unambiguous language.]

4. Actionability (1/2) [While the answer provides valuable information about the impacts of grasshopper damage, it only briefly mentions the need for "effective management and control measures" without providing specific, actionable advice. To score full points, it should have included some concrete steps farmers can take to mitigate these impacts.]

5. Relevance (1/1) [The response is highly relevant to the farmer's question, directly addressing the long-term impacts of grasshopper damage on crop yield.]

6. Miscellaneous (-0) [No additional points subtracted.]

Total Score: (8/9)
