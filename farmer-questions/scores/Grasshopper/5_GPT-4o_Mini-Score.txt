1. Accuracy (2/2) [The answer provides accurate information about the impact of weather conditions on grasshopper activity and population dynamics. The temperature range for optimal growth, effects of extreme weather events, and impact on life cycle stages are all correctly stated.]

2. Comprehensiveness (2/2) [The response covers multiple aspects of weather impacts, including temperature, moisture, extreme events, and their effects on different stages of grasshopper life cycles. It also touches on the implications for farmers.]

3. Clarity (2/2) [The answer is well-structured, presenting information in a logical flow. It uses clear language and provides specific examples to illustrate points, making it easy to understand.]

4. Actionability (1/2) [While the answer suggests that understanding weather patterns can help farmers anticipate outbreaks and implement strategies, it lacks specific, practical advice. It mentions monitoring populations and applying control measures but doesn't provide detailed steps or examples of these measures.]

5. Relevance (1/1) [The response directly addresses the farmer's question about weather conditions affecting grasshopper activity and population dynamics.]

6. Miscellaneous (-0) [No additional points subtracted.]
