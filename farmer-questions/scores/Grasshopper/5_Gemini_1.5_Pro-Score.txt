1. Accuracy (2/2) [The answer provides accurate information about how weather conditions affect grasshopper activity and population dynamics. The statements about warm, dry weather favoring grasshopper survival and development, and cool, wet weather negatively impacting populations are correct and well-established in entomological research.]

2. Comprehensiveness (2/2) [The response covers multiple aspects of weather effects on grasshoppers, including development, behavior, population dynamics, egg survival, nymph development, and the impact of different weather conditions. It also touches on the implications for farmers, making it a thorough answer.]

3. Clarity (2/2) [The answer is well-structured, presenting information in a logical flow. It clearly explains the effects of both favorable and unfavorable weather conditions on grasshoppers, making it easy for the farmer to understand the relationship between weather and grasshopper populations.]

4. Actionability (1/2) [While the answer provides valuable information, it only briefly mentions actionable advice at the end. It suggests that farmers can use this knowledge to predict potential outbreaks and implement early monitoring and control measures, but it doesn't provide specific steps or detailed guidance on how to do this.]

5. Relevance (1/1) [The response is highly relevant to the farmer's question, directly addressing how weather conditions affect grasshopper activity and population dynamics.]

6. Miscellaneous (-0) [No additional points subtracted.]
