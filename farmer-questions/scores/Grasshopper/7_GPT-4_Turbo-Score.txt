1. Accuracy (2/2) [The answer provides accurate information about economic thresholds for grasshopper control in alfalfa. The ranges given (8-14 grasshoppers per square yard for young alfalfa and 15-20 for mature stands) are consistent with established agricultural guidelines.]

2. Comprehensiveness (1/2) [The response covers the basic economic thresholds and mentions the importance of monitoring. However, it lacks information on specific monitoring techniques, potential control measures, or factors that might influence these thresholds such as environmental conditions or market prices.]

3. Clarity (2/2) [The answer is well-structured and easy to understand. It clearly differentiates between thresholds for young and mature alfalfa stands.]

4. Actionability (1/2) [While the answer provides specific thresholds, it doesn't offer detailed advice on how to conduct counts or what specific control measures to implement when thresholds are exceeded. This limits its immediate actionability.]

5. Relevance (1/1) [The response directly addresses the farmer's question about economic thresholds for grasshopper control in alfalfa.]

6. Miscellaneous (-0) [No additional points subtracted.]
