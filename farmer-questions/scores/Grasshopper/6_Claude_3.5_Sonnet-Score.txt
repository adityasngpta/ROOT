1. Accuracy (2/2) [The answer provides accurate information about biological control agents for grasshoppers, including specific examples of fungi, parasitic wasps, nematodes, and natural predators. The information provided is correct and well-supported by scientific literature.]

2. Comprehensiveness (2/2) [The response covers a wide range of biological control agents, including microbial (fungus), parasitic insects (wasps), nematodes, and natural predators (birds). It also mentions the concept of integrated pest management, providing a thorough overview of the topic.]

3. Clarity (2/2) [The answer is well-structured, clear, and easy to understand. It presents information in a logical order, starting with microbial control and moving to larger organisms. The language used is precise yet accessible.]

4. Actionability (1/2) [While the answer provides good information on various biological control agents, it lacks specific guidance on how farmers can practically implement these methods. It doesn't mention where to obtain these agents or how to apply them effectively.]

5. Relevance (1/1) [The response is highly relevant to the farmer's question, directly addressing biological control agents for grasshoppers.]

6. Miscellaneous (-0) [No additional points subtracted.]
