1. Accuracy (2/2) [The answer provides accurate information about grasshopper damage and its long-term impacts on crop yield. The statements about grasshoppers' feeding habits, potential for defoliation, and the factors affecting damage extent are correct.]

2. Comprehensiveness (2/2) [The response thoroughly addresses multiple aspects of long-term impacts, including direct crop damage, cumulative yield losses, increased susceptibility to other stressors, soil health effects, and potential economic consequences. It also touches on management strategies.]

3. Clarity (2/2) [The answer is well-structured, clear, and easy to understand. It progresses logically from immediate impacts to long-term consequences and concludes with management suggestions.]

4. Actionability (1/2) [While the answer provides some actionable advice in the final paragraph, it lacks specific, detailed recommendations for farmers to implement. The suggestions are somewhat general and could benefit from more practical, step-by-step guidance.]

5. Relevance (1/1) [The response is highly relevant to the farmer's question, directly addressing the long-term impacts of grasshopper damage on crop yield.]

6. Miscellaneous (-0) [No additional points subtracted.]

Total Score: (8/9)
