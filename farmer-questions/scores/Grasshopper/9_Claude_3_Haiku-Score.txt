1. Accuracy (2/2) [The answer provides accurate information about grasshopper damage and its long-term impacts on crop yield. The description of grasshoppers as voracious feeders, their ability to defoliate crops, and the cyclical nature of outbreaks are all correct.]

2. Comprehensiveness (2/2) [The response thoroughly addresses the long-term impacts, including immediate yield losses, weakening of plants, increased susceptibility to other stresses, and the potential for multi-year impacts due to cyclical outbreaks. It also mentions mitigation strategies, providing a comprehensive overview.]

3. Clarity (2/2) [The answer is well-structured, clear, and easy to understand. It progresses logically from immediate impacts to long-term consequences and concludes with mitigation advice.]

4. Actionability (1/2) [While the answer mentions the need for integrated pest management strategies and lists general categories (cultural, biological, and selective chemical controls), it lacks specific, actionable advice that a farmer could immediately implement.]

5. Relevance (1/1) [The response is highly relevant to the farmer's question, directly addressing the long-term impacts of grasshopper damage on crop yield.]

6. Miscellaneous (-0) [No additional points subtracted.]

Total Score: (8/9)
