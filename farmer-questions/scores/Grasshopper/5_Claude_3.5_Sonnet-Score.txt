1. Accuracy (2/2) [The answer provides accurate information about how temperature, rainfall, humidity, and wind affect grasshopper activity and population dynamics. The information aligns with established entomological knowledge.]

2. Comprehensiveness (2/2) [The response covers all major weather factors (temperature, rainfall, humidity, wind) and their impacts on grasshopper populations. It addresses both positive and negative effects of these factors, providing a thorough overview.]

3. Clarity (2/2) [The answer is well-structured, with clear paragraphs focusing on different weather aspects. The language is straightforward and easy to understand, avoiding ambiguity.]

4. Actionability (1/2) [While the answer provides valuable information about weather effects on grasshoppers, it lacks specific, actionable advice for farmers. It mentions that understanding these factors can help farmers prepare, but doesn't offer concrete steps or strategies.]

5. Relevance (1/1) [The response directly addresses the farmer's question about weather conditions and grasshopper activity/population dynamics, providing relevant information throughout.]

6. Miscellaneous (-0) [No additional points subtracted.]
