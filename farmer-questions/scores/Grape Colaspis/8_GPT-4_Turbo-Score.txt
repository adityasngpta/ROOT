1. Accuracy (2/2) [The answer provides accurate information about Grape Colaspis preferences for soil types, specifically mentioning their preference for lighter, well-drained soils like sandy loams. The explanation of how soil type affects larval movement and feeding is correct.]

2. Comprehensiveness (2/2) [The response covers multiple aspects of how soil type affects Grape Colaspis populations, including larval preferences, movement, feeding habits, and the impact on infestation severity. It also touches on the implications for farm management.]

3. Clarity (2/2) [The answer is well-structured and easy to understand. It logically progresses from explaining soil preferences to their effects on the pest and finally to the implications for farmers.]

4. Actionability (1/2) [While the answer suggests that understanding soil type can help predict infestation levels and guide management strategies, it lacks specific, practical advice. It mentions "targeted soil treatments" and "selection of crop varieties" but doesn't provide detailed recommendations.]

5. Relevance (1/1) [The response directly addresses the farmer's question about how soil type affects Grape Colaspis populations.]

6. Miscellaneous (-0) [No additional points subtracted.]
