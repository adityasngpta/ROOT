1. Accuracy (2/2) [The answer provides accurate information about Grape Colaspis and its damage to grapevines. The description of both adult and larval damage is correct, and the symptoms described are consistent with scientific literature on this pest.]

2. Comprehensiveness (2/2) [The response covers all major aspects of Grape Colaspis damage, including above-ground symptoms (wilting, stunted growth, leaf discoloration, and distinctive leaf damage), below-ground symptoms (root damage), and overall plant health effects (reduced fruit production, shoot dieback). It also mentions the common name and scientific relevance.]

3. Clarity (2/2) [The answer is well-structured, clear, and easy to understand. It progresses logically from general symptoms to specific damage caused by adults and larvae, concluding with advice for farmers.]

4. Actionability (1/2) [While the answer suggests that farmers should regularly inspect their vineyards and take appropriate action, it lacks specific, practical advice on how to conduct these inspections or what actions to take. More detailed guidance would have been beneficial.]

5. Relevance (1/1) [The response is highly relevant to the farmer's question, directly addressing the signs of Grape Colaspis damage in grapevines.]

6. Miscellaneous (-0) [No additional points subtracted.]
