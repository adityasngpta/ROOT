1. Accuracy (2/2) [The answer provides accurate information about Bean Leaf Beetles' preference for legumes and how crop rotation disrupts their life cycle. The recommendation for rotating crops for at least two years is also correct.]

2. Comprehensiveness (1/2) [The answer covers the main aspects of how crop rotation impacts Bean Leaf Beetle populations. However, it misses some important details such as the potential for beetles to migrate from nearby fields, the impact on natural predators, or the possibility of using trap crops.]

3. Clarity (2/2) [The answer is well-structured and easy to understand. It clearly explains the relationship between crop rotation and Bean Leaf Beetle populations without ambiguity.]

4. Actionability (2/2) [The answer provides specific, practical advice that farmers can implement. It suggests rotating to non-legume crops and gives a timeframe for rotation (at least two years).]

5. Relevance (1/1) [The answer directly addresses the farmer's question about the impact of crop rotation on Bean Leaf Beetle populations.]

6. Miscellaneous (-0) [No additional points subtracted.]

Total Score: (8/9)
