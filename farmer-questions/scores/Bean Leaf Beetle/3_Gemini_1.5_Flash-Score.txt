1. Accuracy (2/2) [The answer provides accurate information about Bean Leaf Beetles' behavior and scouting techniques.

2. Comprehensiveness (2/2) [The response covers all key aspects of scouting for BLBs, including the optimal time, frequency, where to look, what to look for (both adults and larvae), and why early detection is important. It also mentions environmental factors that influence BLB activity.]

3. Clarity (2/2) [The answer is well-structured, easy to understand, and free of ambiguity. It presents information in a logical order, starting with the optimal time and then providing additional details about scouting techniques and reasons for the recommended approach.]

4. Actionability (2/2) [The response offers specific, practical advice that farmers can easily implement. It provides a clear time frame for scouting, describes where to look on the plants, and recommends a scouting frequency. This information allows farmers to take immediate action in their fields.]

5. Relevance (1/1) [The answer directly addresses the farmer's question about the optimal time to scout for Bean Leaf Beetles, providing relevant information that goes beyond just the time aspect to include comprehensive scouting guidance.]

6. Miscellaneous (-0) [No points subtracted; the answer is comprehensive and well-rounded without any notable issues.]
