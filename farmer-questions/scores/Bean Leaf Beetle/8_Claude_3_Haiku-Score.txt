1. Accuracy (2/2) [The answer provides accurate information about crop rotation's impact on Bean Leaf Beetle populations. It correctly identifies the pest's primary host crops and explains how rotation disrupts their life cycle.]

2. Comprehensiveness (2/2) [The response thoroughly addresses the question, covering the mechanism of crop rotation's impact, its effects on the pest population, and mentioning its role in integrated pest management.]

3. Clarity (2/2) [The answer is well-structured, clear, and easy to understand. It logically explains the concept without using overly technical language.]

4. Actionability (1/2) [While the answer explains the principle of crop rotation, it lacks specific recommendations on rotation schedules or which non-host crops are most effective. It provides general advice but could be more detailed for practical implementation.]

5. Relevance (1/1) [The response is highly relevant to the farmer's question, directly addressing how crop rotation impacts Bean Leaf Beetle populations.]

6. Miscellaneous (-0) [No additional points subtracted.]

Total Score: (8/9)
