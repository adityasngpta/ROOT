1. Accuracy (2/2) [The answer provides accurate information about how various weather conditions affect stink bug activity and population dynamics. The effects of temperature, humidity, rainfall, wind, and extreme weather events are correctly described.]

2. Comprehensiveness (2/2) [The response thoroughly addresses multiple aspects of weather conditions and their impact on stink bugs, including temperature, humidity, rainfall, wind, and extreme weather events. It covers both positive and negative effects on the insects.]

3. Clarity (2/2) [The answer is well-structured, clear, and easy to understand. It presents information in a logical order, explaining each weather factor's impact separately.]

4. Actionability (1/2) [While the answer provides valuable information, it only offers one actionable piece of advice at the end: "Farmers should monitor local weather patterns and forecasts to anticipate potential increases in stink bug activity and plan their pest management strategies accordingly." It lacks specific, practical steps farmers can take based on different weather conditions.]

5. Relevance (1/1) [The response is highly relevant to the farmer's question, directly addressing how weather conditions affect stink bug activity and population dynamics.]

6. Miscellaneous (-0) [No additional points subtracted.]
