1. Accuracy (2/2) [The answer provides accurate information about the effects of temperature, winter conditions, and rainfall on Stink Bug activity and population dynamics. All statements are consistent with established entomological knowledge.]

2. Comprehensiveness (2/2) [The response covers multiple aspects of weather conditions affecting Stink Bugs, including temperature, winter severity, and rainfall. It addresses both positive and negative impacts on the pest population.]

3. Clarity (2/2) [The answer is well-structured, presenting information in a logical order. It uses clear language and specific examples (e.g., temperature thresholds) to illustrate points.]

4. Actionability (1/2) [While the answer provides valuable information, it lacks specific, actionable advice for farmers. It mentions "timely pest management strategies" but doesn't provide examples or guidance on how to implement this knowledge.]

5. Relevance (1/1) [The response directly addresses the farmer's question about weather conditions and their impact on Stink Bug activity and population dynamics.]

6. Miscellaneous (-0) [No additional points subtracted.]
