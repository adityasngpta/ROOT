1. Accuracy (2/2) [The answer provides accurate information about the long-term impacts of Stink Bug damage on crop yield. It correctly describes the feeding mechanism, types of damage, and potential for secondary infections. The information about cumulative yield losses and impacts on perennial crops is also accurate.]

2. Comprehensiveness (2/2) [The response thoroughly addresses the question, covering direct feeding damage, pathogen transmission, impact on marketability, effects on plant health, and long-term consequences for both annual and perennial crops. It also mentions the importance of management strategies.]

3. Clarity (2/2) [The answer is well-structured, clear, and easy to understand. It progresses logically from immediate damage to long-term impacts, using appropriate terminology without being overly technical.]

4. Actionability (1/2) [While the answer provides valuable information about the impacts of Stink Bug damage, it only briefly mentions management strategies at the end. It could have provided more specific, actionable advice for farmers to mitigate these long-term impacts.]

5. Relevance (1/1) [The response is highly relevant to the farmer's question, directly addressing the long-term impacts of Stink Bug damage on crop yield.]

6. Miscellaneous (-0) [No additional points subtracted.]
