1. Accuracy (2/2) [The answer provides accurate information about the impact of tillage on Southern Corn Rootworm populations. It correctly states that conventional tillage can reduce populations by exposing eggs and larvae, while conservation tillage may lead to increased populations due to better overwintering habitat.]

2. Comprehensiveness (2/2) [The response thoroughly addresses the question, covering both conventional and conservation tillage methods. It also mentions the limitations of tillage as a sole control method and suggests other management strategies.]

3. Clarity (2/2) [The answer is well-structured, clear, and easy to understand. It presents information logically, starting with conventional tillage and then discussing conservation tillage.]

4. Actionability (1/2) [While the answer provides useful information, it lacks specific, practical advice that a farmer could immediately implement. It mentions other control methods but doesn't provide detailed guidance on how to apply them.]

5. Relevance (1/1) [The response is highly relevant to the farmer's question, directly addressing the impact of tillage on Southern Corn Rootworm populations.]

6. Miscellaneous (-0) [No additional points subtracted.]
