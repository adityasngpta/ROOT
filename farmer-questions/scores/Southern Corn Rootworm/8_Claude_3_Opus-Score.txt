1. Accuracy (2/2) [The answer provides accurate information about intercropping and its effects on Southern Corn Rootworm infestations. The explanation of how intercropping works, including the trap crop concept and increased biodiversity, is correct and well-supported by scientific understanding.]

2. Comprehensiveness (2/2) [The response thoroughly addresses the question, covering multiple aspects of how intercropping can reduce rootworm infestations. It includes examples, explains the mechanism of action, mentions natural predators, and acknowledges potential limitations.]

3. Clarity (2/2) [The answer is well-structured, clear, and easy to understand. It progresses logically from explaining intercropping to its specific effects on rootworms, without any ambiguity.]

4. Actionability (1/2) [While the answer provides useful information, it lacks specific, practical advice on how to implement intercropping. It doesn't mention optimal crop combinations, planting ratios, or timing, which would make it more actionable for farmers.]

5. Relevance (1/1) [The response is highly relevant to the farmer's question, directly addressing how intercropping can reduce Southern Corn Rootworm infestations.]

6. Miscellaneous (-0) [No additional points deducted.]
