1. Accuracy (2/2) [The answer provides accurate information about the impact of tillage on Southern Corn Rootworm populations. It correctly explains how conventional tillage can disrupt the pest's life cycle and how conservation tillage might promote higher populations.]

2. Comprehensiveness (2/2) [The response thoroughly addresses the question, covering both conventional and conservation tillage practices. It explains the mechanisms by which tillage affects SCR populations, including exposure to environmental factors and changes in habitat.]

3. Clarity (2/2) [The answer is well-structured and easy to understand. It clearly differentiates between conventional and conservation tillage practices and their respective impacts on SCR populations.]

4. Actionability (1/2) [While the answer provides useful information, it lacks specific, practical advice for farmers. It mentions the need to "carefully consider" tillage practices and "adopt methods" for pest management, but doesn't offer concrete steps or recommendations.]

5. Relevance (1/1) [The response is highly relevant to the farmer's question, directly addressing how tillage impacts Southern Corn Rootworm populations.]

6. Miscellaneous (-0) [No additional points subtracted.]
