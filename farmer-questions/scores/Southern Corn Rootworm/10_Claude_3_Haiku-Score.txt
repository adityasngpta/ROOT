1. Accuracy (2/2) [The answer provides accurate information about biological control methods for Southern Corn Rootworms, including the use of entomopathogenic nematodes (Steinernema and Heterorhabditis species) and parasitic wasps (Celatoria diabroticae). The information on how these methods work is correct.]

2. Comprehensiveness (2/2) [The response covers multiple biological control methods, explains how they work, mentions specific species, and even touches on application methods. It also advises farmers to consult local experts for tailored advice.]

3. Clarity (2/2) [The answer is well-structured, easy to understand, and free of ambiguity. It explains technical concepts like entomopathogenic nematodes in a clear manner.]

4. Actionability (1/2) [While the answer provides some actionable advice, such as using standard spraying equipment for nematodes, it lacks specific details on application rates, timing, or how to source these biological control agents. The recommendation to consult local experts is good but doesn't provide immediate actionable steps.]

5. Relevance (1/1) [The answer is highly relevant to the farmer's question, directly addressing biological control methods for Southern Corn Rootworms.]

6. Miscellaneous (-0) [No additional points subtracted.]
