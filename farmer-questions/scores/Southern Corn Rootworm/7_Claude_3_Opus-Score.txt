1. Accuracy (2/2) [The answer provides accurate information about the impact of tillage on Southern Corn Rootworm populations. It correctly describes how conventional tillage can disrupt the SCR life cycle and how no-till practices can create a more favorable environment for SCR. The information aligns with current agricultural research and pest management practices.]

2. Comprehensiveness (2/2) [The response thoroughly addresses the question, covering both conventional tillage and no-till practices. It explains the mechanisms by which tillage affects SCR populations, discusses the pros and cons of different tillage methods, and mentions additional control measures. The answer also touches on the broader context of pest management strategies.]

3. Clarity (2/2) [The answer is well-structured, clear, and easy to understand. It uses appropriate terminology without being overly technical, making it accessible to farmers. The information is presented logically, starting with conventional tillage, then no-till practices, and concluding with a summary.]

4. Actionability (1/2) [While the answer provides useful information about the impact of tillage on SCR populations, it lacks specific, actionable advice for farmers. It mentions the need for additional control measures but doesn't provide detailed recommendations on how to implement them. To improve actionability, the response could have included more specific guidelines or steps for farmers to follow.]

5. Relevance (1/1) [The answer is highly relevant to the farmer's question, directly addressing how tillage impacts Southern Corn Rootworm populations and providing context for different tillage practices.]

6. Miscellaneous (-0) [No additional points subtracted.]
