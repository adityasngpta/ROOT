1. Accuracy (1/2) [The answer provides generally accurate information about economic thresholds for Southern Corn Rootworm, but it lacks specificity and verification. The range of 5 to 8 larvae per plant is not universally accepted and may vary by region. The response doesn't acknowledge the difficulty in scouting for larvae or mention specific scouting methods.]

2. Comprehensiveness (1/2) [The answer covers the basic concept of economic thresholds and mentions some factors that influence them. However, it misses important details such as specific scouting techniques, the timing of scouting, or how to accurately count larvae. It also doesn't address the variability of thresholds across different growth stages or soil types.]

3. Clarity (2/2) [The answer is well-structured and easy to understand. It presents information in a logical order and uses clear language.]

4. Actionability (1/2) [The answer provides some actionable advice, such as monitoring for adult beetles and considering integrated pest management strategies. However, it lacks specific, practical steps for implementing these suggestions or for accurately determining if the threshold has been reached.]

5. Relevance (1/1) [The answer directly addresses the farmer's question about economic thresholds for Southern Corn Rootworm control.]

6. Miscellaneous (-0) [No additional points subtracted.]
