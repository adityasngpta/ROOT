1. Accuracy (2/2) [The answer provides accurate information about the impact of tillage on Southern Corn Rootworm populations, including its effects on eggs, larvae, and crop residues. The information about the alternate name (spotted cucumber beetle) and the need for balanced pest management is also correct.]

2. Comprehensiveness (2/2) [The response thoroughly addresses the question, covering multiple aspects of how tillage affects the rootworm population. It includes information on the pest's life cycle, the direct and indirect effects of tillage, and considerations for integrated pest management.]

3. Clarity (2/2) [The answer is well-structured, clear, and easy to understand. It logically progresses from explaining the impact of tillage to discussing its benefits and limitations.]

4. Actionability (1/2) [While the answer provides useful information, it lacks specific, practical advice on how to implement tillage effectively against Southern Corn Rootworm. It mentions the need for judicious use and integration with other methods but doesn't offer concrete steps or recommendations.]

5. Relevance (1/1) [The response is highly relevant to the farmer's question, directly addressing how tillage impacts Southern Corn Rootworm populations.]

6. Miscellaneous (-0) [No additional points subtracted.]
