1. Accuracy (2/2) [The answer provides accurate information about the Southern Corn Rootworm and its effects on corn crops. The description of the pest, its alternative name, and the signs of infestation are all correct.]

2. Comprehensiveness (1/2) [The answer covers most aspects of the question, including visible plant symptoms and adult beetle appearance. However, it misses some important details such as specific root damage symptoms (e.g., pruning of root tips) and doesn't mention larval damage, which is the primary cause of concern.]

3. Clarity (2/2) [The answer is well-structured, clear, and easy to understand. It presents information in a logical order, starting with general information and moving to specific symptoms.]

4. Actionability (1/2) [While the answer provides useful information for identifying an infestation, it lacks specific, actionable advice for farmers on what to do once they've identified these signs. It mentions the importance of early detection but doesn't provide next steps.]

5. Relevance (1/1) [The answer is highly relevant to the farmer's question, directly addressing the signs of Southern Corn Rootworm infestation in corn crops.]

6. Miscellaneous (-0) [No additional points subtracted.]
