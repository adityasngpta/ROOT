1. Accuracy (2/2) [The answer provides accurate information about the economic threshold for Western Corn Rootworm (WCR) control. The threshold of 0.75 beetles per plant during peak beetle activity is correct and widely accepted. The timeframe of late July to early August for peak activity is also accurate.]

2. Comprehensiveness (2/2) [The response covers all key aspects of the question, including the specific threshold, timing, factors to consider (cost of control, corn price, field history, rotation practices, Bt resistance), and mentions various control strategies (crop rotation, Bt corn hybrids, soil-applied insecticides). It also emphasizes the importance of local conditions and recommendations.]

3. Clarity (2/2) [The answer is well-structured, clear, and easy to understand. It presents information in a logical order, starting with the threshold and then expanding on related factors and considerations.]

4. Actionability (2/2) [The response provides specific, actionable advice. It gives a clear threshold (0.75 beetles per plant) and timeframe for monitoring, and outlines various control strategies that farmers can implement. The advice to align with local extension recommendations adds to its actionability.]

5. Relevance (1/1) [The answer is highly relevant to the farmer's question, directly addressing the economic thresholds for Western Corn Rootworm control and providing additional context and considerations.]

6. Miscellaneous (-0) [No points subtracted. The answer is comprehensive, accurate, and well-balanced.]

Total Score: (9/9)
