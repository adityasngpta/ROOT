1. Accuracy (2/2) [The answer provides accurate information about crop rotation's impact on Western Corn Rootworm populations, including the traditional effectiveness of the method and the potential for adaptation in some regions. The information aligns with current scientific understanding of the topic.]

2. Comprehensiveness (2/2) [The response covers all key aspects of the question, including how crop rotation works against rootworms, its effectiveness, potential limitations due to pest adaptation, and the need for ongoing monitoring. It also mentions specific non-host crops and explains the mechanism of population reduction.]

3. Clarity (2/2) [The answer is well-structured, logically presented, and easy to understand. It avoids jargon and clearly explains concepts like the rootworm's life cycle and how crop rotation disrupts it.]

4. Actionability (1/2) [While the answer provides good general information, it lacks specific, practical advice for farmers to implement. It could have included more actionable details on how to effectively use crop rotation or how to monitor for signs of adaptation.]

5. Relevance (1/1) [The response directly addresses the farmer's question about the impact of crop rotation on Western Corn Rootworm populations, providing relevant information throughout.]

6. Miscellaneous (-0) [No additional points subtracted.]
