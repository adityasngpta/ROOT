1. Accuracy (2/2) [The answer provides accurate information about how weather conditions affect Western Corn Rootworm (WCR) activity and damage. It correctly states the impact of temperature, soil moisture, and rainfall on WCR development and survival.]

2. Comprehensiveness (2/2) [The response thoroughly addresses various weather conditions (temperature, moisture, rainfall) and their effects on both the pest and the crop. It also mentions the importance of timing between crop growth and pest activity.]

3. Clarity (2/2) [The answer is well-structured, clear, and easy to understand. It logically progresses from general information to specific weather impacts and management strategies.]

4. Actionability (1/2) [While the answer suggests monitoring weather patterns and mentions some management strategies (modifying planting dates, using resistant hybrids, targeted insecticide applications), it lacks specific details on how to implement these strategies effectively.]

5. Relevance (1/1) [The response is highly relevant to the farmer's question, directly addressing how different weather conditions affect WCR activity and damage.]

6. Miscellaneous (-0) [No additional points subtracted.]
