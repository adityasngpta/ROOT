1. Accuracy (2/2) [The answer provides accurate information about Western Corn Rootworm (WCR) biology and the impact of crop rotation on their populations. The statements about WCR larvae feeding primarily on corn roots, adults laying eggs in cornfields, and the effectiveness of rotating with non-host crops are all correct.]

2. Comprehensiveness (2/2) [The response thoroughly addresses the question, covering the mechanism of how crop rotation impacts WCR populations, providing examples of non-host crops, explaining the life cycle disruption, and even mentioning the recommended rotation period for optimal control.]

3. Clarity (2/2) [The answer is well-structured, clear, and easy to understand. It logically explains the concept of crop rotation's impact on WCR populations without using overly technical language.]

4. Actionability (2/2) [The response provides specific, actionable advice by recommending a 3- to 4-year rotation period for optimal control. It also mentions practical alternatives like soybeans, alfalfa, or small grains as non-host crops.]

5. Relevance (1/1) [The answer is highly relevant to the farmer's question, directly addressing how crop rotation impacts Western Corn Rootworm populations.]

6. Miscellaneous (-0) [No points subtracted.]

Total Score: (9/9)
