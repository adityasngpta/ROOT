1. Accuracy (2/2) [The answer provides accurate information about natural predators of Western Corn Rootworms, including specific species of entomopathogenic nematodes, carabid beetles, and bird species. The information aligns with current scientific understanding of biological control for this pest.]

2. Comprehensiveness (2/2) [The response covers a range of natural predators, including microscopic organisms (nematodes), insects (beetles), and birds. It also touches on the concept of habitat management and reduced insecticide use for encouraging these predators, providing a comprehensive overview.]

3. Clarity (2/2) [The answer is well-structured, clear, and easy to understand. It presents information in a logical order, explaining the role of each predator without using overly technical language.]

4. Actionability (1/2) [While the answer provides useful information about natural predators, it lacks specific, practical advice on how farmers can implement these biological control methods. It mentions habitat management but doesn't provide details on how to do this effectively.]

5. Relevance (1/1) [The response is highly relevant to the farmer's question, directly addressing natural predators of Western Corn Rootworms.]

6. Miscellaneous (-0) [No additional points subtracted.]
