1. Accuracy (2/2) [The answer provides accurate information about the impact of crop rotation on Western Corn Rootworm populations. It correctly explains the pest's lifecycle, feeding habits, and how crop rotation disrupts their population growth.]

2. Comprehensiveness (2/2) [The response thoroughly addresses the question, covering the mechanism of crop rotation's impact, the consequences of continuous corn planting, and the benefits of using non-host crops. It also touches on the broader implications for pest management and soil health.]

3. Clarity (2/2) [The answer is well-structured, clear, and easy to understand. It logically explains the concept without using overly technical language, making it accessible to farmers.]

4. Actionability (1/2) [While the answer provides a clear understanding of why crop rotation is effective, it lacks specific recommendations on rotation schedules or which non-host crops are best to use. More detailed, actionable advice would have earned full points.]

5. Relevance (1/1) [The response is highly relevant to the farmer's question, directly addressing how crop rotation impacts Western Corn Rootworm populations.]

6. Miscellaneous (-0) [No additional points subtracted.]
