1. Accuracy (2/2) [The answer provides accurate information about crop rotation's impact on Western Corn Rootworm populations, including the pest's preference for corn, the disruption of its life cycle through rotation, and the adaptation of some populations to crop rotation. All statements are factually correct and well-supported.]

2. Comprehensiveness (2/2) [The response thoroughly addresses all aspects of the question, including the basic mechanism of crop rotation's effectiveness, its impact on rootworm populations, and even mentions the adaptation of some rootworm populations to this strategy. It also suggests additional management strategies, covering potential nuances and implications.]

3. Clarity (2/2) [The answer is well-structured, clear, and easy to understand. It progresses logically from explaining the basic concept to more complex issues like pest adaptation, without any ambiguity.]

4. Actionability (1/2) [While the answer provides good general advice on using crop rotation and mentions the need for longer rotation cycles or additional strategies, it lacks specific, practical details on how to implement these strategies effectively. More concrete recommendations would improve actionability.]

5. Relevance (1/1) [The response is highly relevant to the farmer's question, directly addressing how crop rotation impacts Western Corn Rootworm populations.]

6. Miscellaneous (-0) [No additional points subtracted.]
