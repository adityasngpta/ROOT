3. Clarity (2/2) [The answer is clear, well-structured, and easy to understand. It provides a straightforward timeline and explains why this period is crucial for scouting.]

4. Actionability (1/2) [The answer provides some actionable advice by suggesting weekly scouting and mentioning what to look for (beetles and silk clipping). However, it lacks specific details on how to conduct the scouting or what actions to take based on observations.]

5. Relevance (1/1) [The answer is highly relevant to the farmer's question, directly addressing when to scout for Western Corn Rootworms.]

6. Miscellaneous (-0) [No additional points subtracted.]
