1. Accuracy (2/2) [The answer provides accurate information about the impact of crop rotation on Western Corn Rootworm populations. It correctly states that rotation disrupts the pest's life cycle, mentions appropriate non-host crops, and acknowledges the adaptation of some rootworm species to rotation.]

2. Comprehensiveness (2/2) [The response covers all key aspects of how crop rotation affects Western Corn Rootworm populations, including the pest's life cycle, feeding habits, habitat disruption, and even touches on soil health benefits and the need for integrated pest management.]

3. Clarity (2/2) [The answer is well-structured, easy to understand, and free of ambiguity. It presents information in a logical flow, making it clear how crop rotation impacts the pest population.]

4. Actionability (1/2) [While the answer provides general advice on crop rotation and mentions the importance of a well-planned rotation strategy, it lacks specific, practical details on how to implement an effective rotation plan. It could have included more actionable information, such as recommended rotation intervals or specific crop combinations.]

5. Relevance (1/1) [The response is highly relevant to the farmer's question, directly addressing how crop rotation impacts Western Corn Rootworm populations.]

6. Miscellaneous (-0) [No additional points subtracted.]
