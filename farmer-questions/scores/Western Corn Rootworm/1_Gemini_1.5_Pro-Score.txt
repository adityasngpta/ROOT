Let's evaluate the AI assistant's answer based on the given rubric:

1. Accuracy (2/2) [The answer provides accurate information about Western Corn Rootworm infestation signs, including root damage, plant symptoms, and adult beetle identification. The details about root browning, pruning, stunted growth, wilting, and lodging are all correct.]

2. Comprehensiveness (2/2) [The response covers both below-ground (root damage) and above-ground (plant symptoms, adult beetles) signs of infestation. It addresses early signs, progression of damage, and the importance of scouting, providing a thorough overview.]

3. Clarity (2/2) [The answer is well-structured, starting with root symptoms, progressing to plant symptoms, and then discussing adult beetles. The language is clear and easy to understand, avoiding ambiguity.]

4. Actionability (1/2) [While the answer provides useful information, it lacks specific, practical advice on how to scout effectively or what to do if these signs are observed. It mentions the importance of regular scouting but doesn't provide details on frequency or methods.]

5. Relevance (1/1) [The response directly addresses the farmer's question about early signs of Western Corn Rootworm infestation in corn fields, providing relevant information throughout.]
