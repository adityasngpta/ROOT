1. Accuracy (2/2) [The answer provides accurate information about cloverworms and their impact on soybean plants. It correctly identifies the primary damage as leaf feeding, mentions irregular holes in leaves, and accurately describes the potential impact on yield and plant health.]

2. Comprehensiveness (2/2) [The response covers all key aspects of cloverworm damage, including the type of damage, severity of impact, effects on yield, and potential secondary consequences. It also mentions the importance of monitoring and intervention.]

3. Clarity (2/2) [The answer is well-structured, clear, and easy to understand. It progresses logically from describing the damage to explaining its consequences and concludes with management advice.]

4. Actionability (1/2) [While the answer suggests monitoring and timely intervention, it lacks specific, practical advice on how to identify cloverworms, what thresholds to look for, or what specific interventions to use. This reduces its actionability for farmers.]

5. Relevance (1/1) [The response is highly relevant to the farmer's question, directly addressing the damage caused by cloverworms to soybean plants.]

6. Miscellaneous (-0) [No additional points subtracted.]
