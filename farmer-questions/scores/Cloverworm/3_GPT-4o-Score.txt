1. Accuracy (2/2) [The answer provides accurate information about the Cloverworm's life cycle, including the four stages, duration of larval and pupal stages, and multiple generations per year. The control measures mentioned are also accurate and relevant.]

2. Comprehensiveness (2/2) [The response thoroughly addresses all aspects of the question, covering both the life cycle and its implications for control measures. It includes details on each life stage and explains how understanding the life cycle affects various control strategies.]

3. Clarity (2/2) [The answer is well-structured, clear, and easy to understand. It presents information in a logical order, first explaining the life cycle and then linking it to control measures.]

4. Actionability (2/2) [The response provides specific, practical advice that farmers can implement. It mentions various control strategies, including chemical (insecticides), cultural (crop rotation, field hygiene), and biological (parasitic wasps, predatory insects) methods, along with the importance of timing interventions based on the life cycle.]

5. Relevance (1/1) [The answer is highly relevant to the farmer's question, directly addressing both the life cycle of the Cloverworm and how it affects control measures.]

6. Miscellaneous (-0) [No points subtracted.]
