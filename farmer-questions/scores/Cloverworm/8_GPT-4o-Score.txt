1. Accuracy (2/2) [The answer provides accurate information about how weather conditions affect Cloverworm activity and damage. It correctly states that Cloverworms thrive in warm, humid environments, and that extreme temperatures can suppress their activity. The information about heavy rainfall washing away larvae and eggs is also accurate.]

2. Comprehensiveness (2/2) [The response addresses multiple aspects of weather conditions, including temperature, humidity, and rainfall. It covers both favorable and unfavorable conditions for Cloverworms, and mentions the impact on their life cycle, feeding activity, and population dynamics.]

3. Clarity (2/2) [The answer is well-structured and easy to understand. It presents information in a logical order, starting with favorable conditions and then discussing unfavorable ones. The language used is clear and free of ambiguity.]

4. Actionability (1/2) [While the answer suggests monitoring weather patterns to anticipate outbreaks, it lacks specific, practical advice on how farmers can use this information. It mentions implementing "timely pest management strategies" but doesn't provide examples of what these strategies might be.]

5. Relevance (1/1) [The response is highly relevant to the farmer's question, directly addressing how weather conditions affect Cloverworm activity and damage.]

6. Miscellaneous (-0) [No additional points subtracted.]
