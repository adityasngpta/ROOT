1. Accuracy (0/2) [The answer contains significant inaccuracies. Cloverworms are not weevils (Hypera postica), but rather caterpillars of moths in the genus Plathypena. This fundamental misidentification leads to incorrect information about pheromone traps and control methods.]

2. Comprehensiveness (1/2) [While the answer addresses the main question about pheromone traps, it provides some alternative monitoring methods. However, due to the initial misidentification, much of the information is not applicable to actual cloverworms.]

3. Clarity (1/2) [The answer is structured clearly, but the incorrect information makes it misleading. The transition to alternative methods is smooth, but based on false premises.]

4. Actionability (1/2) [Some actionable advice is provided, such as visual inspection of fields. However, the advice is partially based on incorrect information about the pest, reducing its practical value.]

5. Relevance (1/1) [Despite the inaccuracies, the answer attempts to address the farmer's question about pheromone traps and provides alternative monitoring methods, maintaining relevance to the query.]

6. Miscellaneous (-1) [An additional point is deducted for the critical error in pest identification, which undermines the entire response.]

Total Score: (3/9)
