1. Accuracy (1/2) [The answer contains a significant error. The scientific name provided (Hypera punctata) is incorrect for Cloverworm. Cloverworm is typically Plathypena scabra. This mistake could lead to confusion and misidentification. The rest of the information about pheromone traps and their use is generally accurate.]

2. Comprehensiveness (2/2) [The answer thoroughly addresses the question, explaining what pheromone traps are, how they work for Cloverworm monitoring, and why they are useful. It also touches on the broader implications for pest management.]

3. Clarity (2/2) [The response is well-structured, clear, and easy to understand. It explains concepts in a straightforward manner without ambiguity.]

4. Actionability (1/2) [While the answer provides general information about the use of pheromone traps, it lacks specific, practical advice on how to implement this method. It doesn't mention where to obtain these traps, how to set them up, or how to interpret the results.]

5. Relevance (1/1) [The answer is highly relevant to the farmer's question, directly addressing the availability and use of pheromone traps for Cloverworm monitoring.]

6. Miscellaneous (-1) [An additional point is deducted for the significant error in scientific naming, as this could lead to serious misunderstandings or misapplications in pest management.]

Total Score: (6/9)
