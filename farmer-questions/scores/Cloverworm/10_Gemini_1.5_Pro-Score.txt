3. Clarity (2/2) [The answer is well-structured, easy to understand, and free of ambiguity. It logically progresses from explaining intercropping to discussing additional management practices.]

4. Actionability (1/2) [While the answer provides some actionable advice, such as intercropping with non-host crops and regular monitoring, it lacks specific details on implementation. For example, it doesn't mention which specific non-host crops work best or how often to monitor.]
