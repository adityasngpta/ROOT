1. Accuracy (2/2) [The answer provides accurate information about biological control agents for Dectes Stem Borers, including specific examples like parasitic wasps of the genus Bracon and entomopathogenic nematodes. The information aligns with current scientific understanding of biological control methods for this pest.]

2. Comprehensiveness (2/2) [The response covers multiple aspects of biological control, including specific agents (parasitic wasps and nematodes), their mode of action, and the suggestion to use these as part of an integrated pest management strategy. It also mentions additional cultural practices, providing a well-rounded answer.]

3. Clarity (2/2) [The answer is well-structured, clear, and easy to understand. It avoids jargon and explains concepts in a straightforward manner, such as describing how parasitic wasps work to control the pest.]

4. Actionability (1/2) [While the answer provides useful information on biological control agents, it lacks specific guidance on how to obtain or apply these agents. More detailed instructions on implementation would improve actionability.]

5. Relevance (1/1) [The response directly addresses the farmer's question about biological control agents for Dectes Stem Borers, providing relevant information and examples.]

6. Miscellaneous (-0) [No additional points subtracted.]
