1. Accuracy (2/2) [The answer accurately describes the relationship between planting date and Dectes Stem Borer infestation risk. It correctly states that early planting increases risk due to alignment with the pest's lifecycle, while later planting can reduce risk. The information provided is consistent with established agricultural knowledge.]

2. Comprehensiveness (1/2) [The answer covers the main aspects of how planting date affects infestation risk. However, it misses some important details such as specific optimal planting dates, regional variations, or other factors that might interact with planting date to influence infestation risk.]

3. Clarity (2/2) [The answer is well-structured and easy to understand. It clearly explains the relationship between planting date and infestation risk, using logical progression from early to late planting scenarios.]

4. Actionability (1/2) [The answer provides general advice about later planting being advantageous, which is somewhat actionable. However, it lacks specific recommendations on ideal planting dates or how to balance this strategy with other agronomic considerations.]

5. Relevance (1/1) [The answer is highly relevant to the farmer's question, directly addressing how planting date affects the risk of Dectes Stem Borer infestation.]

6. Miscellaneous (-0) [No additional points subtracted.]
