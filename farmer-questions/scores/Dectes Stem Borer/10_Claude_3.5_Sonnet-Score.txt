1. Accuracy (2/2) [The answer provides accurate information about the relationship between planting date and Dectes Stem Borer infestation risk. The timing of adult beetle emergence and egg-laying is correctly stated, and the explanation of why earlier planting reduces risk is accurate.]

2. Comprehensiveness (2/2) [The response thoroughly addresses the question, covering the main aspects of how planting date affects infestation risk. It includes information on beetle lifecycle, crop vulnerability, and even touches on balancing pest management with other agronomic factors.]

3. Clarity (2/2) [The answer is well-structured, clear, and easy to understand. It logically progresses from explaining the general principle to providing specific details and considerations.]

4. Actionability (1/2) [While the answer provides useful information that can guide farmer decisions, it lacks specific, practical advice on optimal planting dates or how to determine them. It mentions considering local climate and pest pressure but doesn't offer concrete steps for implementation.]

5. Relevance (1/1) [The response is highly relevant to the farmer's question, directly addressing how planting date affects Dectes Stem Borer infestation risk.]

6. Miscellaneous (-0) [No additional points subtracted.]
