1. Accuracy (2/2) [The answer provides accurate information about the Dectes Stem Borer larvae, including their size, color, distinctive features, and behavior. The description of the sclerotized plate behind the head and the girdling behavior are particularly accurate and helpful for identification.]

2. Comprehensiveness (2/2) [The response covers multiple aspects of identification, including physical characteristics (size, color, distinctive features) and behavioral traits (tunneling, girdling). It also mentions the primary host plant (soybeans) and the location where the larvae are typically found.]

3. Clarity (2/2) [The answer is well-structured and easy to understand. It presents information in a logical order, starting with physical characteristics and moving on to behavior. The language used is clear and avoids ambiguity.]

4. Actionability (1/2) [While the answer provides useful information for identification, it doesn't explicitly guide the farmer on how to apply this knowledge in the field. It could be more actionable by suggesting specific steps for inspection or comparison with other stem borers.]

5. Relevance (1/1) [The response directly addresses the farmer's question about distinguishing Dectes Stem Borer larvae from other stem borers, providing relevant identification criteria.]

6. Miscellaneous (-0) [No additional points subtracted.]
