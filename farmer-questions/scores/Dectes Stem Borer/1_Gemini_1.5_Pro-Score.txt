1. Accuracy (2/2) [The answer provides accurate information about the symptoms of Dectes Stem Borer infestation in sunflower plants. The description of wilting leaves, entry holes, plant lodging, stem severance, and frass accumulation are all correct and consistent with scientific literature on this pest.]

2. Comprehensiveness (2/2) [The response covers a wide range of symptoms, from early signs (wilting) to later-stage indicators (lodging, stem severance). It also mentions the progression of symptoms and provides details about the location and appearance of signs, offering a thorough overview.]

3. Clarity (2/2) [The answer is well-structured, starting with early symptoms and progressing to later ones. The language is clear and easy to understand, avoiding jargon while still being precise. The description of each symptom is vivid and helps the farmer visualize what to look for.]

4. Actionability (1/2) [While the answer provides detailed information on what to look for, it lacks specific advice on how frequently to check for these symptoms or what immediate actions to take if symptoms are spotted. The last sentence hints at management strategies but doesn't provide specific actionable steps.]
