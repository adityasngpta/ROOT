1. Accuracy (2/2) [The answer provides accurate information about the relationship between no-till farming and Dectes Stem Borer populations. It correctly explains how crop residue can provide overwintering sites for the pest, potentially increasing survival rates. The information about biodiversity and natural enemies is also accurate.]

2. Comprehensiveness (2/2) [The response addresses multiple aspects of how no-till farming affects Dectes Stem Borer populations, including both potential increases in pest survival and the promotion of natural enemies. It also mentions management strategies, providing a well-rounded answer.]

3. Clarity (2/2) [The answer is well-structured and easy to understand. It logically progresses from explaining the impact of no-till farming on pest populations to discussing potential management strategies.]

4. Actionability (1/2) [While the answer mentions some management strategies (crop rotation, timely harvest, resistant varieties, and monitoring), it lacks specific details on how to implement these strategies. More concrete advice would have made it more actionable for farmers.]

5. Relevance (1/1) [The response directly addresses the farmer's question about the relationship between no-till farming and Dectes Stem Borer populations.]

6. Miscellaneous (-0) [No additional points subtracted.]
