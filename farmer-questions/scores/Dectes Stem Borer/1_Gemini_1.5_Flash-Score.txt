2. Comprehensiveness (2/2) [The response covers a wide range of symptoms, including wilting, stunted growth, physical damage to stems, delayed flowering, and the presence of adult beetles. It addresses both visible plant symptoms and signs of the pest itself.]

3. Clarity (2/2) [The answer is well-structured with bullet points for each symptom, making it easy to read and understand. The language used is clear and accessible to farmers.]

4. Actionability (1/2) [While the answer provides detailed information on identifying the infestation, it lacks specific actionable advice on what to do once these symptoms are observed. The last sentence mentions taking action but doesn't provide concrete steps.]

5. Relevance (1/1) [The response directly addresses the farmer's question about symptoms of Dectes stem borer infestation in sunflower plants.]

6. Miscellaneous (-0) [No additional points deducted.]
