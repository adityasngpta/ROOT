1. Accuracy (2/2) [The answer provides accurate information about the relationship between cover crops and Dectes Stem Borer populations. It correctly states that research is limited and results are variable, and it accurately describes potential positive and negative effects of cover crops on borer populations.]

2. Comprehensiveness (2/2) [The response thoroughly addresses the question, covering both potential positive and negative impacts of cover crops on Dectes Stem Borer populations. It discusses different types of cover crops, their effects, and factors that influence the outcome.]

3. Clarity (2/2) [The answer is well-structured, clear, and easy to understand. It presents information logically, starting with the research status, then discussing potential negative and positive effects, and concluding with factors that influence outcomes.]

4. Actionability (1/2) [While the answer provides useful information, it lacks specific, practical advice that farmers can immediately implement. The recommendation to consult local extension agents is good, but more concrete suggestions for cover crop management would have been beneficial.]

5. Relevance (1/1) [The response is highly relevant to the farmer's question, directly addressing the influence of cover crops on Dectes Stem Borer populations.]

6. Miscellaneous (-0) [No additional points subtracted.]
