1. Accuracy (2/2) [The answer is completely accurate. It correctly identifies the Dectes Stem Borer as primarily affecting soybeans, explains its overwintering behavior, and accurately describes how crop rotation with non-host crops can break the pest's life cycle. The information provided is factually correct and well-verified.]

2. Comprehensiveness (2/2) [The answer thoroughly addresses all aspects of the question. It explains how crop rotation works against Dectes Stem Borer, provides examples of suitable rotation crops, describes the mechanism of control, and even mentions the limitations of this method and the need for integrated pest management.]

3. Clarity (2/2) [The answer is clear, well-structured, and easy to understand. It progresses logically from explaining the pest's behavior to how crop rotation affects it, and finally to practical implementation advice.]

4. Actionability (2/2) [The answer provides specific, practical advice that a farmer can implement. It suggests rotating soybeans with corn, wheat, or sorghum, and recommends alternating crops every year or every other year.]

5. Relevance (1/1) [The answer is highly relevant to the farmer's question, directly addressing how crop rotation can help manage Dectes Stem Borer infestations.]

6. Miscellaneous (-0) [No points subtracted. The answer maintains a high standard throughout.]

Total Score: (9/9)
