1. Accuracy (2/2) [The answer provides accurate information about the impact of no-till farming on Dectes Stem Borer populations. It correctly describes the pest's behavior, the effects of crop residues, and the impact on the pest's life cycle.]

2. Comprehensiveness (2/2) [The response thoroughly addresses multiple aspects of how no-till farming affects Dectes Stem Borer populations, including oviposition, larval development, overwintering, and overall pest management.]

3. Clarity (2/2) [The answer is well-structured, clear, and easy to understand. It logically progresses from introducing the pest to explaining the various effects of no-till farming on its population.]

4. Actionability (1/2) [While the answer provides valuable information about the effects of no-till farming on Dectes Stem Borer populations, it doesn't offer specific, actionable advice for farmers to implement. It could have included practical tips for maximizing the benefits of no-till farming for pest control.]

5. Relevance (1/1) [The response is highly relevant to the farmer's question, directly addressing how no-till farming affects Dectes Stem Borer populations.]

6. Miscellaneous (-0) [No additional points subtracted.]
