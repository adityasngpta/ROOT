1. Accuracy (2/2) [The answer accurately describes the relationship between planting date and Dectes Stem Borer infestation risk. It correctly states that early planting results in more mature plants that are less susceptible to damage, while late-planted crops are at higher risk.]

2. Comprehensiveness (2/2) [The response thoroughly addresses the question, explaining how both early and late planting affects the risk of infestation. It also touches on the implications for crop damage and yield losses.]

3. Clarity (2/2) [The answer is well-structured, clear, and easy to understand. It logically presents the information, starting with early planting and then contrasting it with late planting.]

4. Actionability (1/2) [While the answer implies that adjusting the planting date can be an effective strategy, it doesn't provide specific, practical advice on optimal planting times or how to determine the best planting date for a particular region. More actionable details would improve this aspect.]

5. Relevance (1/1) [The response is highly relevant to the farmer's question, directly addressing how planting date affects the risk of Dectes Stem Borer infestation.]

6. Miscellaneous (-0) [No additional points subtracted.]
