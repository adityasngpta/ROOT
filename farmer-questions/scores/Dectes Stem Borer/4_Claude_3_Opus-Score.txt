1. Accuracy (2/2) [The answer provides accurate information about the relationship between no-till farming and Dectes Stem Borer populations. It correctly explains the mechanism by which no-till practices can lead to higher pest populations and provides a factual comparison of infestation rates between no-till and conventional tillage.]

2. Comprehensiveness (2/2) [The response thoroughly addresses all aspects of the question, including the reasons for increased pest populations, comparison with conventional tillage, and management strategies. It covers the pest's life cycle, overwintering habits, and the impact of different farming practices.]

3. Clarity (2/2) [The answer is well-structured, clear, and easy to understand. It logically progresses from explaining the impact of no-till farming on pest populations to comparing it with conventional tillage and finally offering management strategies.]

4. Actionability (2/2) [The response provides specific, practical, and actionable advice for farmers dealing with Dectes Stem Borer in no-till systems. It suggests multiple management strategies including crop rotation, adjusted planting times, and insecticide use, emphasizing an integrated approach.]

5. Relevance (1/1) [The answer is highly relevant to the farmer's question, directly addressing how no-till farming affects Dectes Stem Borer populations and providing additional context and management information.]

6. Miscellaneous (-0) [No points subtracted.]
