1. Accuracy (2/2) [The answer provides accurate information about crop rotation's role in managing Dectes Stem Borer infestations. It correctly states that crop rotation can be helpful but not a standalone solution, mentions the pest's wide host range, and accurately describes the importance of weed control.]

2. Comprehensiveness (2/2) [The response thoroughly addresses the question, covering multiple aspects such as the effectiveness of crop rotation, the pest's host range, the importance of weed control, and the need for a comprehensive approach. It also explains why crop rotation alone may not be sufficient.]

3. Clarity (2/2) [The answer is well-structured, clear, and easy to understand. It logically progresses from introducing the concept to explaining its limitations and requirements for effectiveness.]
