1. Accuracy (2/2) [The answer provides accurate information about the Dectes Stem Borer's impact on crops, particularly soybeans and sunflowers. The description of larval damage, lodging, and potential yield reductions is correct. The mention of integrated pest management strategies is also accurate.]

2. Comprehensiveness (2/2) [The response thoroughly addresses the long-term effects of Dectes Stem Borer damage, covering immediate impacts on plant health, yield reductions, increased susceptibility to other stresses, and potential soil depletion. It also touches on management strategies, providing a comprehensive overview.]

3. Clarity (2/2) [The answer is well-structured, clear, and easy to understand. It logically progresses from the immediate effects to long-term consequences and management strategies.]

4. Actionability (1/2) [While the answer mentions integrated pest management strategies, it lacks specific, detailed advice on how to implement these strategies. More concrete recommendations would have improved actionability.]

5. Relevance (1/1) [The response directly addresses the farmer's question about long-term effects on crop yield, providing relevant information throughout.]

6. Miscellaneous (-0) [No additional points subtracted.]
