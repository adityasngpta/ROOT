Pest Cluster Region (0/1) [The analysis incorrectly identifies the pest cluster as being located in the northeast region, when the ground truth data shows the cluster is actually in the southeast region.]

Infestation Severity (1/1) [The analysis accurately identifies the severity of the infestation as high, based on the maximum pest count of 10 per plant.]

Max Pest Count (1/1) [The analysis correctly determines that the most infested plant has 10 pests.]

Pest Cluster Size (0/1) [The analysis states the pest cluster size is 6 cells, but the ground truth data shows the actual cluster size is 9 plants.]

Total Pest Count (0/1) [The analysis states there are 42 total pests, but the ground truth data shows there are 70 pests in the field.]

Field Size (1/1) [The analysis correctly determines the field size is 5 rows by 7 columns.]

Treatment Insights (2/3) [The analysis provides generally relevant recommendations for pest management, such as targeted pesticide application and monitoring. However, the recommendations lack specificity and do not fully consider all the critical factors like the location of the pest cluster, the high infestation severity, and the total pest count. The insights could be more data-driven and actionable.]

Miscellaneous (-1) [The analysis incorrectly identifies the location of the pest cluster, which is a significant error that impacts the overall quality of the recommendations.]

Total Score: (4/9)
