Pest Cluster Region (0/1) [The analysis incorrectly identifies the pest cluster as being located in the northwest region of the field, when the ground truth data shows the cluster is actually located in the center region.]

Infestation Severity (1/1) [The analysis accurately identifies the severity of the infestation as moderate.]

Max Pest Count (1/1) [The analysis correctly determines that the most infested plant has 10 pests.]

Pest Cluster Size (0/1) [The analysis states the pest cluster spans 8 cells, but the ground truth data shows the cluster is 9 plants in size.]

Total Pest Count (0/1) [The analysis states there are 47 pests in the field, but the ground truth data shows there are 63 pests.]

Field Size (1/1) [The analysis correctly determines the field size is 7 rows by 5 columns.]

Treatment Insights (2/3) [The analysis provides generally relevant recommendations for pest management, such as a targeted approach using moderate pesticide treatment and implementing monitoring systems. However, the recommendations lack some specificity and do not fully consider all the critical factors like the high pest count and the need for more aggressive treatment in the center cluster region.]

Miscellaneous (-1) [The analysis incorrectly states the pest cluster is located in the northwest region, which is a significant error.]

Total Score: (4/9)
