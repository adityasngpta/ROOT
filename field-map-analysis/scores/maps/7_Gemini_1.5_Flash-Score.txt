Pest Cluster Region (1/1) [The analysis correctly identifies the pest cluster as located in the northwest region of the field.]
Infestation Severity (0/1) [The analysis incorrectly states that the infestation is of low severity, when the ground truth data indicates a high severity infestation with a maximum pest count of 7 per plant.]
Max Pest Count (1/1) [The analysis accurately determines that the most infested plant has 7 pests.]
Pest Cluster Size (0/1) [The analysis incorrectly states that the pest cluster size is 3 plants, when the ground truth data shows the cluster size is 4 plants.]
Total Pest Count (0/1) [The analysis incorrectly states that there are 13 pests in the field, when the ground truth data shows there are 15 pests.]
Field Size (1/1) [The analysis accurately determines the field size as 7 rows by 5 columns.]
Treatment Insights (2/3) [The analysis provides generally relevant recommendations for pest management and prevention, such as using light pesticide treatment or natural predators, monitoring for further spread, and investigating potential causes. However, the recommendations lack specificity and do not fully consider all critical factors like the high severity of the infestation.]

Miscellaneous (-1) [The analysis makes several incorrect statements about the infestation severity and cluster size, which are significant errors that impact the overall quality of the recommendations.]
