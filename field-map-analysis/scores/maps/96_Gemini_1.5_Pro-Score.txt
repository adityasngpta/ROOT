Pest Cluster Region (0/1) [The analysis incorrectly identifies the pest cluster as being located in the northwest region, when the ground truth data shows the cluster is actually in the southwest region.]

Infestation Severity (1/1) [The analysis accurately identifies the severity of the infestation as high, based on the maximum pest count of 9.]

Max Pest Count (1/1) [The analysis correctly determines that the most infested plant has 9 pests.]

Pest Cluster Size (0/1) [The analysis incorrectly states the pest cluster size is 6 plants, when the ground truth data shows the cluster is 9 plants.]

Total Pest Count (0/1) [The analysis incorrectly states there are 32 pests in the field, when the ground truth data shows there are 37 pests.]

Field Size (1/1) [The analysis accurately determines the field size is 5 rows by 5 columns.]

Treatment Insights (2/3) [The analysis provides generally relevant recommendations for pest management and prevention, such as immediate and intensive pesticide treatment in the affected area and investigating potential causes. However, the recommendations lack some specificity and detail that could make them more actionable, such as the exact location of the cluster, the need for monitoring and preventive measures beyond just pesticides, and consideration of the total pest count and cluster size.]

Miscellaneous (-1) [The analysis incorrectly states the pest cluster is in the northwest region, when the ground truth data shows it is in the southwest region. This is a significant error that impacts the overall quality of the analysis.]

Total Score: (4/9)
