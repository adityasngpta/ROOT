Max Pest Count (1/1) [The analysis correctly determines that the most infested plant has 10 pests.]

Pest Cluster Size (0/1) [The analysis states the pest cluster size is 6 cells, but the ground truth data shows the cluster size is 9 plants. The analysis fails to correctly determine the size of the pest cluster.]

Total Pest Count (0/1) [The analysis states there are a total of 27 pests in the field, but the ground truth data shows there are 33 pests. The analysis fails to correctly determine the total number of pests in the field.]
