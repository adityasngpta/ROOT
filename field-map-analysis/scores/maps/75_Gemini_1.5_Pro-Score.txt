Pest Cluster Region (1/1) [The analysis accurately identifies the pest cluster as located in the center region of the field.]
Infestation Severity (1/1) [The analysis correctly identifies the severity of the infestation as high, with a maximum pest count of 7 per plant.]
Max Pest Count (0/1) [The analysis states the maximum pest count is 7, but the ground truth data shows the maximum pest count is 9.]
Pest Cluster Size (1/1) [The analysis accurately determines the size of the pest cluster as 3 plants.]
Total Pest Count (0/1) [The analysis states the total pest count is 19, but the ground truth data shows the total pest count is 21.]

Treatment Insights (2/3) [The analysis provides generally relevant recommendations for pest management and prevention, such as a targeted pesticide treatment and regular monitoring. However, the recommendations lack some specificity and could be more data-driven, considering factors like the high pest count and cluster size.]
