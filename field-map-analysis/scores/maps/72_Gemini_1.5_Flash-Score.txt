Pest Cluster Region (0/1) [The analysis incorrectly identifies the pest cluster as being located in the southeast region, when the ground truth data shows the cluster is actually located in the center region of the field.]

Infestation Severity (1/1) [The analysis accurately identifies the infestation severity as moderate, which matches the ground truth data.]

Max Pest Count (1/1) [The analysis correctly determines the maximum pest count is 10, which aligns with the ground truth data.]

Pest Cluster Size (1/1) [The analysis accurately identifies the pest cluster size as 9 plants, consistent with the ground truth information.]

Total Pest Count (0/1) [The analysis states there are 53 total pests in the field, but the ground truth data shows there are actually 63 pests.]

The suggestions for preventive measures are appropriate but could be more detailed.]
