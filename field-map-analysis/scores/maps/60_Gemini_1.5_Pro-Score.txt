Pest Cluster Region (1/1) [The analysis correctly identifies the pest cluster as located in the southeast region of the field.]

Pest Cluster Size (1/1) [The analysis accurately determines the size of the pest cluster as 9 plants.]
Total Pest Count (0/1) [The analysis incorrectly states there are 39 pests in the field, when the ground truth data shows there are 53 pests.]

Treatment Insights (2/3) [The analysis provides generally relevant recommendations for pest management and prevention, such as immediate and intensive pesticide treatment in the affected area, continued monitoring, and consideration of preventive measures.
