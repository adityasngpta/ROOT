Pest Cluster Region (0/1) [The analysis correctly identifies the pest cluster as being located in the northwest region of the field, but the description states it is in the "northwest region" when the ground truth data shows the cluster is actually in the center region of the field.]

Infestation Severity (1/1) [The analysis accurately identifies the severity of the infestation as moderate, which matches the ground truth data showing a high severity cluster.]

Max Pest Count (1/1) [The analysis correctly determines that the most infested plant has 9 pests, which matches the ground truth data.]

Pest Cluster Size (1/1) [The analysis accurately determines the size of the pest cluster as 7 plants, which matches the ground truth data.]

Total Pest Count (0/1) [The analysis states there are 41 total pests in the field, but the ground truth data shows there are 57 pests.]

Field Size (1/1) [The analysis correctly identifies the field size as 7 rows by 5 columns, which matches the ground truth data.]

Treatment Insights (2/3) [The analysis provides generally relevant recommendations for pest management and prevention, such as a targeted pesticide treatment and introducing natural predators. However, the recommendations lack some specificity and do not fully consider all the critical factors like the high severity of the infestation and the total pest count.]

Miscellaneous (-1) [The analysis incorrectly states the pest cluster is located in the northwest region, when the ground truth data shows it is actually in the center region. This is a significant error that impacts the overall accuracy of the analysis.]

Total Score: (5/9)
