Pest Cluster Region (0/1) [The analysis incorrectly identifies the pest cluster as being located in the northwest region, when the ground truth data shows the cluster is actually in the southwest region.]

Infestation Severity (1/1) [The analysis accurately identifies the severity of the infestation as high.]

Max Pest Count (1/1) [The analysis correctly determines that the most infested plant has 10 pests.]

Pest Cluster Size (0/1) [The analysis incorrectly states the pest cluster size is 6 plants, when the ground truth data shows the cluster is 9 plants.]

Total Pest Count (0/1) [The analysis states there are 38 pests in the field, but the ground truth data shows there are 43 pests.]

Field Size (1/1) [The analysis correctly determines the field size is 5 rows by 5 columns.]

Treatment Insights (2/3) [The analysis provides generally relevant recommendations for pest management and prevention, such as immediate and intensive pesticide treatment in the affected area and monitoring the rest of the field. However, the recommendations lack some specificity and do not fully consider all critical factors like the pest type, severity, and field conditions.]

Miscellaneous (-1) [The analysis incorrectly identifies the pest cluster location and size, as well as the total pest count, which are significant errors.]

Total Score: (4/9)
