The pest infestation in your field is concentrated in the southeast region, forming a small cluster. The highest number of pests in a single cell is 9, indicating a moderate level of infestation.  The cluster size is 4, meaning pests are present in 4 cells of the field. The total number of pests in the field is 20. The field size is 7 rows and 5 columns. While the pest count is moderate, the localized nature of the cluster suggests a potential point source of infestation. This could be due to factors like a localized pest breeding ground or an uneven application of pesticides. 

Given the moderate severity (max pest count >= 4), I recommend a moderate pesticide treatment focused specifically on the southeast region of your field. Additionally, consider implementing preventative measures like rotating crops, using resistant varieties, and maintaining good field hygiene to prevent future infestations. Monitoring the southeast region for any resurgence of pests after treatment is crucial. You should also investigate potential sources of the infestation in the southeast corner to prevent recurrence.
