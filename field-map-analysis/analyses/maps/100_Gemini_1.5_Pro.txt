The pest infestation in your field appears to be localized to a small cluster in the northeast region of the field. This cluster is characterized by a low severity infestation, with a maximum pest count of 3.  There are a total of 3 cells in the matrix with pests, indicating a relatively small cluster size. The total number of pests in the field is 7, and the field size is 5x5. Given the low severity of the infestation, I recommend a light pesticide treatment or the use of natural predators to control the pests. This approach minimizes the use of harsh chemicals while effectively addressing the limited pest population.  To prevent future infestations, consider implementing preventive measures such as crop rotation, which disrupts the pests' lifecycle, and maintaining good field sanitation by removing plant debris where pests can overwinter. Regularly monitoring the field for early signs of pest activity will allow for timely intervention should any new infestations arise. The localized nature of this infestation could be related to factors such as wind direction, proximity to other infested fields, or even the presence of a microclimate within your field.
