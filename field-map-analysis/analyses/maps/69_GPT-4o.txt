Upon analyzing the provided pest distribution matrix of size 5x7, it is clear that the majority of the field is free from significant pest infestations, with a few notable exceptions concentrated in the upper-left region. The highest number of pests in a single cell is 9, located at the second row and first column, indicating a high-severity cluster. This region also includes cells with pest counts of 2 and 1, suggesting a localized infestation.

There are a total of three cells with pests, resulting in an overall cluster size of 3 and a total number of 14 pests in the entire field. The position of the pest cluster can be described as being in the 'northwest' area of the field. Given the high severity indicated by the presence of a cell with a pest count of 9, immediate and intensive pesticide treatment is strongly recommended for the northwest region of the field to prevent the infestation from spreading.

To manage this issue effectively, consider using systemic insecticides that target the specific pests identified or applying a broad-spectrum pesticide that can address multiple pest types. Additionally, mechanical removal of heavily infested plants in this area might help in controlling the pest population.

For ongoing management and prevention of future infestations, implement an integrated pest management (IPM) system that includes regular monitoring, use of natural predators, and maintaining field hygiene. Ensure to avoid moisture buildup and address any environmental factors that may contribute to pest proliferation, such as excessive humidity or neighboring infested fields. Early detection through weekly inspections can help in identifying minor infestations before they escalate into severe outbreaks.

In conclusion, the northwest region's high-severity infestation necessitates immediate and focused intervention, with systemic and robust pest control measures. Consistent preventive practices and monitoring strategies are essential to maintain the health and productivity of the field.
