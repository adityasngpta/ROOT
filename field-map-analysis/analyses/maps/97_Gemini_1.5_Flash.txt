The high maximum pest count (10) necessitates immediate and intensive pesticide treatment. This should be targeted at the central region, with a particular focus on the southeast quadrant.  Furthermore, a comprehensive analysis of the soil and irrigation systems in the affected area is recommended to identify and address any underlying causes.  For prevention, consider rotating crops to break the pest lifecycle, using pest-resistant varieties, and monitoring your fields regularly for early signs of infestation. Additionally, incorporating beneficial insects into your field can help control pest populations naturally.
