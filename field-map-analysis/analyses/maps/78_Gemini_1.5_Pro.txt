The pest infestation in your field is localized to a small cluster in the northwest region, suggesting a potential early-stage infestation or a point source for the pest. The infestation severity is high, evidenced by a maximum pest count of 8. This cluster spans 3 cells and totals 16 pests within a 7x5 field.  Given the high severity, immediate and intensive pesticide treatment is recommended for the affected area to prevent further spread.  Consider investigating potential causes for this localized infestation, such as pest attraction to specific plant varieties or environmental factors like water accumulation in that area. Implementing a regular monitoring schedule for early pest detection will be crucial in preventing future outbreaks.
