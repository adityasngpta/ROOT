The pest infestation in your field appears to be localized to a small cluster in the southeast corner.  This suggests a potential point source for the infestation in that area, or conditions in that part of the field that are particularly favorable to the pest.  The severity of the infestation is moderate, with a maximum pest count of 6 in a single cell. The cluster size is small, with only 2 cells registering any pest presence. In total, there are 9 pests across your entire field.  The field size is 7x5. Given the moderate severity, a targeted application of a moderate-impact pesticide to the affected area in the southeast corner would be the most efficient approach.  Additionally, investigating the potential cause of the concentrated infestation in that corner, such as a possible breeding ground or favorable environmental factors, would be beneficial.  This could involve checking for signs of plant stress, water accumulation, or the presence of pest harborage sites.  For the future, implementing regular monitoring practices, especially in the southeast corner, will allow for early detection and treatment of any recurring infestations.
