The pest infestation in your field is concentrated in the **northwest** region, specifically within the top left quadrant of the field. This cluster exhibits a **high** severity level, as the maximum pest count within a single cell is 9. The cluster size encompasses 7 cells, and the total number of pests within the field is 35. The field size is 5 rows by 5 columns. 

Given the high severity of the infestation, we recommend immediate and intensive pesticide treatment focused on the northwest region. This should help contain the infestation and prevent further damage to your crops. Additionally, consider monitoring the field closely for any signs of re-infestation.

To prevent future infestations, implementing preventive measures such as crop rotation and using resistant varieties can be beneficial.  Furthermore, maintaining good field hygiene by removing any leftover crop debris can help reduce potential breeding grounds for pests. Regular monitoring of the field is crucial for early detection, enabling timely intervention and minimizing the impact of infestations.  The observed concentration of pests in the northwest region might be due to factors such as wind patterns, proximity to a potential source of infestation, or differences in microclimates within the field.
