Based on the matrix provided, the pest infestation in your field appears to be concentrated in the northwest region of the field. The highest number of pests found in a single cell is 7, and there are several cells with pests, specifically:

- One cell with 7 pests,
- One cell with 5 pests,
- One cell with 2 pests, and
- One cell with 1 pest.

This indicates a total of four cells in the matrix where pests are present, taking up a part of the field predominantly in the upper left corner. The sum of pests across the entire field is 15. Given the structure of the matrix (7 rows and 5 columns), the field size can be quantified accordingly.

The severity of this infestation can be classified as high due to the presence of a peak concentration of 7 pests in a single cell. Seeing this level of severity, it is vital to apply an immediate and intensive pesticide treatment focused predominantly in the northwest corner to efficiently manage the infestation before it has a chance to spread further across the field.

In mitigating this pest issue, it is recommended to use a systemic pesticide that can target the pests deeply entrenched within the plant system. This is effective because the high concentration in such a localized area suggests that pests might be burrowing or within plant matter deeper than surface level. Make sure to choose a pesticide that is potent against the type of pest if identified, and always consider consultation with a pest control professional to select the most appropriate chemical or biological treatment.

Preventive measures should be taken to avoid similar future infestations. Regular monitoring of the field should be implemented, focusing on early detection particularly in parts of the field that mirror conditions of the current northwest infestation zone. Consider crop rotation or introducing natural predators if suitable for the type of crop and pest. Additionally, controlling the amount of moisture and regularly clearing crop residue can help prevent the onset of pests.

Overall, addressing the issue promptly with a targeted chemical treatment and maintaining vigilant monitoring and preventive practices can control the current outbreak and diminish future risk.
