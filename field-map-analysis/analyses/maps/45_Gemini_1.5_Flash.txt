The pest infestation in your field exhibits a clear cluster located in the **northeast** region. The highest concentration of pests is found in the top right corner, with a **maximum pest count of 8** in a single cell. The **cluster size** is 8, meaning there are 8 cells in the matrix with pests. The **total number of pests** in the field is 38. The field is **5 rows by 5 columns**. The infestation is considered **high severity** due to the high maximum pest count. 

The distribution of pests indicates a potential problem with irrigation or soil conditions in the northeast region of the field.  The clustered nature of the infestation suggests a localized issue that may be addressed through targeted treatment.

**Immediate and intensive pesticide treatment** is recommended for the entire northeast region of the field, focusing on the cells with the highest pest counts.  You should also consider implementing **preventive measures** such as monitoring soil moisture levels, adjusting irrigation practices, and ensuring proper drainage to prevent future infestations.  Additionally, you should **monitor the field regularly** for any signs of pest activity and be prepared to implement further treatment if necessary.

Remember to always follow label instructions for pesticide use and to take appropriate safety precautions.
