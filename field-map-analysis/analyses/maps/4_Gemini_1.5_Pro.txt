The pest infestation in your field appears to be localized to a small cluster in the northwest corner, suggesting a potential point source for the infestation or highly favorable conditions for the pests in that specific area.  The infestation severity is moderate, with a maximum pest count of 8 in a single cell. The total cluster size is 3 cells, and there are 13 pests in total across your entire field. The field size is 5 rows by 7 columns. Given the moderate severity, I recommend a moderate pesticide treatment focused on the affected area in the northwest corner of the field. This targeted approach will help control the current infestation while minimizing unnecessary pesticide use on the rest of the field.  Additionally, investigate potential causes for this clustered infestation, such as a nearby pest harborage or favorable microclimate conditions.  Implementing monitoring strategies like regular scouting and using pest traps will help detect future infestations early on.
