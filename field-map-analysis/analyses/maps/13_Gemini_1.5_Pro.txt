The pest infestation in your field appears to be centered in the northwest region, exhibiting a concentrated cluster. The severity of the infestation is high, considering the maximum pest count reaches 8. I recommend immediate and intensive pesticide treatment in and around the affected area to prevent further spread. The maximum pest count is 8, found in a single cell. The cluster size is 3 cells, indicating a relatively contained infestation at this point. The total number of pests in the field is 16, and the field size is 5 rows by 5 columns. The localized nature of this infestation suggests that environmental factors or the introduction of pests through a vector might be at play. You should investigate recent weather patterns, adjacent land use, and potential pest entry points.  For the future, consider implementing regular monitoring practices, such as visual inspections and pheromone traps, to ensure early detection of potential pest outbreaks. Additionally, cultural practices like crop rotation and maintaining field hygiene can contribute to long-term pest prevention.
