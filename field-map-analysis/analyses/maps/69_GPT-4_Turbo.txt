Analyzing your provided field matrix, we see a significant pest concentration in the northwest region of the field. This distribution indicates a localized infestation with the pests focused in this specific corner of the field, creating an evident pattern where intervention can be targeted.

In detail, the maximum number of pests on a single plant within this observed distribution is 9, which highlights a spot of high infestation severity. There are four cells with pests, reflected in the numbers (9, 2, 2, and 1), thus giving us a cluster size of 4. The sum total of all pests in the matrix amounts to 14, representing the total pest load in the field.

Given the high severity of infestation (max pest count of 9), immediate and intensive pesticide treatment is recommended to curtail further spread and damage. Specifically, targeting the northwest corner with a focus on the most heavily infested plant (with 9 pests) should be a priority. For this level of infestation, application of a broad-spectrum insecticide or a pesticide specifically effective against the type of pest determined (if known) would be appropriate. Itâ€™s critical to follow this targeted pesticide application with regular monitoring to assess efficacy and need for repeat treatments or adjustment in strategy.

Additionally, I would advise integrating preventive measures to protect the rest of the field. This can include regularly scheduled inspections, installation of barriers or traps to intercept pests migrating from external sources, and potentially introducing natural predators if suitable for the crop and pest type. Understanding factors like crop type, surrounding landscape, and current season could guide more specific recommendations, as certain pests are more active and damaging during specific times of the year and in particular environments.

Consider implanting good agricultural practices such as crop rotation, proper watering regimes, and the maintenance of field hygiene to reduce future infestations. Crop diversification may also help in reducing pest buildup in specific area of the field.

With these actions, you should be able to manage and mitigate the pest issue effectively, aiming to not only address this immediate concern but also establish a healthy, resilient crop environment over the long term.
