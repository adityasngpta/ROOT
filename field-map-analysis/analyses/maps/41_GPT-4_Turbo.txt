Analyzing the field map you provided, it appears that the pest infestation in your field is concentrated in the northeast region. The pests are not evenly distributed across the field, but are rather clustered mostly in the top right section of the matrix.

The highest number of pests in any single cell in this matrix is 10, which indicates a significant infestation in that particular spot. The matrix comprises a total of 11 cells with pests out of 25, giving a cluster size of 11. The total number of pests summed across the entire field is 48. Looking at the pattern, the most severe infestation seems to be in that top right area primarily involving high and moderate pest counts.

With the maximum pest count reaching up to 10, this represents a high severity infestation. I recommend implementing an immediate and intensive pesticide treatment specifically targeted at the northeast part of the field where the highest concentrations are noted. For the remaining parts of the field where pest presence is minimal or absent, a lighter or even preventive treatment strategy could be employed.

In terms of preventive measures to avoid future infestations, ensure regular monitoring of the pest populations, possibly using traps or drones equipped with cameras for larger fields. Crop rotation and maintaining field hygiene by removing debris and weed can also help in lowering pest attractions. Additionally, consider the strategic planting of pest-deterring plants or the use of natural predators such as ladybugs or lacewings in the affected area which could naturally reduce pest populations without harming the crops.

This targeted treatment, combined with regular monitoring and preventive strategies, should help manage and control the pest infestation effectively, ensuring the health and productivity of your crops.
