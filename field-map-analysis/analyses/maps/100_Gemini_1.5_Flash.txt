This field map reveals a low-severity pest infestation, with a maximum pest count of 3, a cluster size of 3 cells, and a total of 7 pests across the entire 5x5 field.  The infestation is concentrated in the **northeast region** of the field. While the pest cluster is relatively small, it's important to act promptly to prevent further spread. Based on the low severity of the infestation, I recommend employing light pesticide treatment or introducing natural predators to manage the pest population. To prevent future infestations, consider implementing a crop rotation system, maintaining good hygiene practices, and monitoring for early signs of pest activity. This specific pattern of pest concentration in the northeast could indicate environmental factors, like wind direction, that may be contributing to their spread. By understanding the root cause, you can take steps to mitigate future infestations.
