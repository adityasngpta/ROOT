The pest infestation in your field appears to be concentrated in the northwest region, indicating a localized cluster. This suggests a potential point source for the infestation or conditions in that area that are particularly favorable to the pests.  The severity of the infestation is high, with a maximum pest count of 10 in a single cell. The cluster size is relatively small, affecting only 6 cells in the field. However, with a total of 38 pests present, there is a risk of the infestation spreading if left untreated.  I recommend immediate and intensive pesticide treatment in and around the affected area to control the infestation quickly and prevent further spread. The rest of the field should be closely monitored for any signs of pests. Consider investigating the northwest region of your field to identify potential causes for the concentrated infestation, such as weed patches, proximity to a water source, or microclimate variations. The field size is 5x5.
