The field map reveals a localized pest infestation concentrated in the northwest region of the field.  This infestation is characterized by a high severity level, with a maximum pest count of 8 observed in two separate cells.  The cluster size is relatively small, encompassing only 3 cells with pests. However, the total number of pests in this cluster is significant, with a count of 20. The field size is 5 rows by 5 columns. Given the high severity of the infestation, immediate and intensive pesticide treatment is recommended for the affected area. Consider spot treatments targeting the infested cells and their immediate surroundings to minimize the impact on the rest of the field. It is crucial to monitor the treated area closely for signs of re-infestation.  Additionally, implement a comprehensive pest management plan that includes regular scouting of the field to detect and address potential pest problems early on. This should involve inspecting crops for signs of pest damage or presence and monitoring environmental conditions that might favor pest development. This proactive approach will help protect your crops from future infestations and ensure the overall health and productivity of your field.
