The pest infestation in your field is concentrated in the southeast region, specifically in the bottom two rows. The cluster is characterized by a high concentration of pests in the lower right corner, with a maximum pest count of 6. The cluster size is 4 cells, with a total of 20 pests. The field size is 7 rows and 5 columns. 

The severity of the infestation can be classified as moderate, given the maximum pest count of 6. We recommend moderate pesticide treatment to effectively manage this infestation. This approach will target the areas of highest pest concentration while minimizing the potential environmental impact. 

Given the localized nature of the infestation, you could consider a targeted application of pesticide only to the affected area. This would help reduce the overall chemical load used, minimizing potential harm to beneficial insects and the environment. You can also explore using natural predator populations to control the pest population, particularly in the areas where pests are less dense. 

To prevent future infestations, consider the following measures:

* **Crop Rotation:** Rotating crops can disrupt the pest life cycle and prevent build-up in specific areas.
* **Good Agricultural Practices:**  Maintaining good field hygiene, such as removing crop residues and weeds, can reduce pest habitat.
* **Early Detection:** Implement regular monitoring strategies to detect pest infestations early. This could involve visual inspection, traps, or pheromone lures.  
* **Biological Control:** Consider introducing natural predators or parasitoids to your field. This can help control pest populations without the use of synthetic pesticides.

By implementing these strategies, you can create a more sustainable pest management plan that minimizes the use of pesticides while maintaining healthy crop yields.
