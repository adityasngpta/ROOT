Your field map indicates a matrix of pest infestations where the maximum pest count is found in the cells located in the central region of the field. Specifically, the highest density is observed in positions (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), and (4,4) with counts of 10 pests, while the overall maximum pest count in a single cell is 10 pests. The pest distribution in your field reflects a significant cluster primarily centered around the middle of the matrix, indicating a concentrated area of infestation. This positioning suggests that the pests may be attracted to particular factors common in central crop growth or environmental conditions such as moisture levels or nutrient availability.

The total number of pest counts across the matrix is 59, and the cluster size, which is the number of cells containing pests, amounts to 7. Given that the maximum pest count exceeds 7, the severity of the infestation is classified as high. It is crucial to act promptly; thus, I recommend immediate and intensive pesticide treatment focused on the central area where the pest densest populations reside. Products that target the specific type of pests you are facing would be ideal, and ideally integrated pest management practices should be employed.

Furthermore, in terms of preventive measures to avoid future infestations, consider rotating your crops, maintaining healthy soil through proper nutrient management, and implementing regular monitoring and scouting of the fields to detect any emergence of pests early. Utilizing beneficial insects or promoting biodiversity in your field can also help maintain pest levels at bay naturally. Since this is a high-intensity infestation, stay vigilant and create a routine schedule for monitoring pest populations to ensure early detection and response in the future. Your field size is 8 rows by 5 columns, and proactive measures will enhance your ability to maintain a healthy crop yield.
