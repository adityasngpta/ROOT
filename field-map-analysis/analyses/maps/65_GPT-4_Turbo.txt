Based on the matrix you've provided, the pest infestation in your field is concentrated primarily in the central-eastern region of the field. The infestation is localized and does not spread across the entire field, which allows for targeted treatment methods.

By analyzing the matrix, the highest pest count in any single cell is 10. The cluster size, or the number of cells that have pests, is 8. The total number of pests summed from all the cells in your field is 57. This matrix is a rectangular grid with 6 rows and 6 columns, making the field size 36 cells in total.

Given the maximum pest count is 10, this is classified as a high severity infestation. Immediate and intensive pesticide treatment in the affected area is recommended to prevent further damage to your crops and to ensure that the pests do not spread to other parts of the field. An application of a broad-spectrum pesticide or a pest-specific agent, depending on what the pests are known to be susceptible to, would be effective. Given the concentration of pests, localized treatment could also be considered to minimize chemical usage and its impact on the environment and non-target species.

In addition to the immediate treatment, implementing regular monitoring of the field with periodic checks can help in early detection of any new infestations. Installation of traps and regular soil health assessments might also prevent future outbreaks. Environmental factors such as humidity, temperature, and crop type should be considered as they might influence pest proliferation. Adjusting planting times or using pest-resistant crop varieties could be beneficial preventive measures tailored to address the underlying causes of infestation pertinent to your specific field conditions.

Regularly clearing the field of debris and avoiding excessive irrigation can also reduce habitats that pests find conducive. Engagement with local agricultural extension services or pest management professionals can provide further bespoke advice and support in implementing both treatment and preventive strategies effectively. 

To summarize, the central-east high severity infestation requires immediate and intensive pesticide treatment, careful monitoring, and possibly some preventive measures to uphold the health and productivity of your crops.
