The matrix representing pests in your field is as follows:

```
2 2 5 0 0
5 4 7 0 0
2 6 5 0 0
0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0
```

Upon reviewing this field map, several insights can be drawn. The highest concentration of pests is located in the second row, particularly at the position (2,2), where there are 7 pests present, indicating a significant cluster. This area is at the center of the matrix, confirming it is a central location for the infestation. The pest counts decrease moving away from this central position, which reveals a gradient of pest density that is highest in the center and tapering off towards the edges.

The total number of cells with pests, or the cluster size, in this field is 10, while the overall pest count sums to 36 across the matrix. Given the maximum pest count of 7 in a single cell, this categorizes the infestation as high severity. Due to the level of pest infestation observed, immediate and intensive pesticide treatment is recommended. 

In addition to the targeted application of pesticides, I further recommend conducting thorough monitoring of the surrounding crops and implementing preventive measures. These may include adopting pest-resistant crop varieties, maintaining healthy soil and crop rotations, and employing traps or barriers to deter pests from establishing in your field in the future. Regular scouting will help identify any early signs of pest activities, allowing for quicker responses.

The observed pest distribution likely correlates with environmental factors such as moisture levels or the crop type used in this area, which may be conducive to pest attraction. Considering these insights will not only aid in managing the infestation currently present but will also help in maintaining the health of your crops in the long term.
