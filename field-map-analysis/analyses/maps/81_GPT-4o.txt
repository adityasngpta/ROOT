Examining the matrix of your field, it's clear that there is a significant pest infestation primarily concentrated in the northeastern region. The severity of the infestation is high, indicated by the maximum pest count of 10 pests on a single plant. The pest distribution shows a distinct clustering toward the upper-right corner of the field. Specifically, the highest densities are found in cells (1, 4) with counts of 9 pests and (2, 5) with counts of 10 pests. This concentration pattern suggests that the northeast area is experiencing the most intense pest problems.

The total number of pests across the field is 46, spanning over 9 cells that contain pests. Given the dimensions of the field (7 rows by 5 columns), the infestation is localized, which makes it easier to address urgently. The observed pattern does not indicate pests in the lower and far left sections of the field, suggesting that those areas are either not yet affected or are less susceptible.

For immediate treatment, due to the high severity of this infestation (with a maximum pest count of 10), an intensive pesticide treatment in the northeastern region is highly recommended. Focus on the plants in rows 1 to 3 and columns 3 to 5 to ensure that all highly infested plants are covered. An intensive treatment might involve the use of both contact and systemic insecticides to tackle the pests effectively, given their high numbers.

Alongside immediate treatment, consider preventive measures to avoid future infestations. Regular monitoring should be in place, perhaps by employing sticky traps or pheromone traps along the borders and especially focused in the northeast quadrant. Rotate crops where possible to disrupt pest breeding cycles and consider introducing natural predators, such as ladybugs or lacewings, which are effective at controlling various pest populations.

It is crucial to look into underlying causes that could contribute to this clustering; environmental factors like wind direction, moisture levels, and proximity to other crops might play a role. Ensuring proper field hygiene and removing plant debris promptly can also reduce pest habitats.

In summary, the northeastern region of your field faces a high-severity pest infestation requiring immediate and intensive pesticide treatment. Monitor the entire field persistently to catch any new infestations early and maintain a steady regimen of preventive practices to safeguard your crops.
