The pest infestation in your field is concentrated in the **northeast region**. The maximum pest count is **10** in a single cell, indicating a high severity of infestation. The cluster size, encompassing cells with pests, is **9**. The total number of pests in the field is **43**. The field size is 7 rows by 5 columns. This high concentration of pests in a specific area suggests a potential issue with environmental factors, such as uneven irrigation or nutrient availability, in that section of the field. The infestation is categorized as high severity due to the maximum pest count exceeding 7. Therefore, I recommend an immediate and intensive pesticide treatment targeting the northeast region. Focus on applying the pesticide to the cells with the highest pest counts (8, 9, and 10) and those surrounding them. To prevent future infestations, consider implementing preventive measures like crop rotation, improving drainage, and using pest-resistant varieties. Regular monitoring for early detection is crucial, which can be achieved by visually inspecting the field or using traps to identify potential pest outbreaks.
