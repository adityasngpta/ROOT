The pest infestation in your field is concentrated in the southeast region, indicating a localized cluster.  The infestation severity is high, with a maximum pest count of 10 in a single cell. This level of infestation requires immediate and intensive pesticide treatment to prevent further spread and crop damage. The cluster size is relatively small, affecting 6 cells in the field.  However, with a total of 46 pests present, swift action is critical. Your field size is 6x6. The localized nature of the infestation suggests a potential point source for the pest outbreak, such as an infected plant or favorable environmental conditions in that specific area.
