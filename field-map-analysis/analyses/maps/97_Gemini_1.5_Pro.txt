The pest infestation in your field appears to be concentrated in a cluster located in the northwest region of the field. This cluster exhibits a moderate severity infestation, with the highest single pest count reaching 10. The cluster itself spans across 6 cells within the field, indicating a localized infestation. In total, there are 43 pests present across the entire field, which consists of 6 rows and 6 columns. Given the moderate severity of the infestation, I recommend a moderate pesticide treatment targeting the northwest region of your field where the cluster is located. It would be wise to monitor the effectiveness of this initial treatment and be prepared to adjust your pest management strategy if needed.
