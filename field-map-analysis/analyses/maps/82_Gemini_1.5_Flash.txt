The pest infestation in your field exhibits a clear cluster in the northwest region. The highest concentration of pests is found in the top left cell, with a maximum pest count of 7.  This suggests a potentially high severity infestation.  The cluster size is 3, indicating that three cells in the field have pests. The total number of pests in the field is 15. The field size is 5 rows by 7 columns. The significant concentration of pests in the northwest region suggests a potential localized issue such as a specific environmental factor or a point source of infestation. It's important to investigate possible causes in that area, such as a nearby weed patch, a water source, or an entry point for migrating pests. Due to the high severity of the infestation, immediate and intensive pesticide treatment is recommended to control the pests effectively. Consider using a broad-spectrum insecticide with proven efficacy against the identified pest species. Additionally, implement preventive measures such as crop rotation and proper sanitation practices to minimize future infestation risks. Regular monitoring of the field, particularly in the northwest region, will be crucial for early detection of any reinfestation or spread to other areas.
