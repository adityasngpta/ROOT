The provided matrix representing the pest infestation on your field shows a clear concentration of pests predominantly in the upper-left corner and towards the center-left of the field. Here, the pest counts in each cell are as follows:

```
9 4 1 0 0 0 0
6 8 2 0 0 0 0
2 4 1 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0
```

Analyzing this field map, the highest concentration of pests is in the northwestern region, with the maximum pest count observed in a single cell being 9. The total number of cells with pests is 9, and the sum total of pests in the field is 37. 

Given the maximum pest count of 9, the severity of the infestation can be classified as high. For such a high-severity infestation, immediate and intensive pesticide treatment is recommended. It is crucial to target the northwestern part of the field aggressively to mitigate spread and limit damage to the crops in adjacent areas. Specifically, you should begin with a high efficacy pesticide, ensuring proper coverage particularly around the areas with counts of 9, 8, 6, and 4, which are indicative of critical spots within the cluster.

For the rest of the field, particularly towards the southern and eastern peripheries where pest presence is negligible or nonexistent, maintenance and monitoring would suffice. To prevent future infestations, adopting integrated pest management (IPM) practices is advantageous. These could include crop rotation, the introduction of natural predators, and maintaining field hygiene to eliminate potential breeding grounds.

It is also important to consider external factors such as environmental conditions, crop type, and the current season, which might contribute to pest infestations. Regular monitoring and early detection strategies, like the use of pheromone traps and routine scouting, are vital to managing and controlling pest populations effectively. These measures will not only help in dealing with the current pests but also in preventing future outbreaks.
