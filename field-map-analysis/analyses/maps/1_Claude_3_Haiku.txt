Based on the field map you provided, I can confirm that there is a pest infestation present in the southeast region of your field. The pest distribution appears to be concentrated in a small cluster, with the highest number of pests (10) found in a single cell. 

The overall severity of this infestation is moderate, with a maximum pest count of 10 and a cluster size of 2 cells. The total number of pests across the field is 22.

To effectively manage this pest issue, I recommend a moderate pesticide treatment focused on the southeast region of the field. This targeted approach should help control the existing infestation without unnecessarily exposing the entire field to pesticides.

Additionally, I suggest implementing preventive measures to avoid future infestations, such as:
- Regularly monitoring the field for early signs of pest activity
- Encouraging the presence of natural predators, such as beneficial insects, to help control pest populations
- Rotating crop types or using companion planting strategies to disrupt the pest's life cycle
- Ensuring proper field sanitation and removal of any plant debris or weeds that could harbor pests

By addressing the current infestation and implementing proactive pest management strategies, you can help protect the overall health and productivity of your crop. Please let me know if you have any other questions or require further assistance.
