The matrix representing the pest distribution in your field is as follows:

```
0 0 0 0 3 10 6
0 0 0 0 7 8 4
0 0 0 0 2 5 7
0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0
```

This field consists of 5 rows and 7 columns, creating a field size of 35 cells. Upon examining the pest counts in each cell, it is evident that there is a significant concentration of pests in the eastern region of the field. The area of highest infestation is located in the northeastern section, where pest counts range from 2 to 10 pests per plant, particularly in the top three rows. This area shows a clear cluster of high pest activity, demonstrating the presence of an intense infestation that could severely impact crop health if not managed promptly.

The highest number of pests found in any single cell is 10, indicating a high severity of infestation. In total, there are 9 cells with pest presences, making the cluster size substantial given the density observed. Summing all pest counts yields a total of 52 pests in the field.

Due to the high severity of the infestation, an immediate and intensive pesticide treatment is recommended for the northeastern part of the field. This treatment should focus on the first three rows from columns 5 to 7 where pest counts are the highest. Given the intensity, a broad-spectrum pesticide would be effective in rapidly reducing pest numbers. Additionally, regular monitoring and potential repeat treatments will be necessary to prevent re-infestation.

Preventive measures that can help avoid future infestations include implementing crop rotation, using pest-resistant crop varieties, and enhancing biological control through the introduction of natural predators. Regular field monitoring should be conducted, particularly in vulnerable areas like the northeastern corner identified here, to ensure early detection of any new pest activity. Environmental factors like humidity and temperature, which favor pest proliferation, should also be controlled when possible.

In conclusion, the pest cluster located in the northeastern region of your field is severe and warrants immediate action. An intensive pesticide treatment focused on the affected cells will help manage the infestation, while continuous monitoring and preventive strategies will aid in maintaining long-term crop health.
