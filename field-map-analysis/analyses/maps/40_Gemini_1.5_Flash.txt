The pest infestation in your field is clustered in the **northwest region**, with a high concentration of pests in the top left corner. The **maximum pest count** is 10, found in the cell at row 2, column 1. This indicates a **high severity** infestation.  The **cluster size** is 3 cells, suggesting a localized outbreak. The **total number of pests** in the field is 25.  Your field is 5 rows by 5 columns. 

This localized infestation suggests a potential source of attraction in the northwest corner, which could be a nearby water source, a specific plant variety, or an environmental factor like shade. The concentration of pests in this area could lead to significant damage to the crop if not addressed quickly. 

I recommend **immediate and intensive pesticide treatment** targeting the northwest corner of the field. Given the high severity, this will help to control the infestation and prevent further damage. 

**Preventive measures** to avoid future infestations include:

* **Monitoring:** Regularly inspect your field for signs of pests, especially in areas where they have been previously found. 
* **Crop Rotation:** Rotate your crops to disrupt the pest life cycle and prevent the build-up of specific pest populations.
* **Diversification:** Plant a variety of crops to create a less hospitable environment for pests. 
* **Natural Predators:** Encourage the presence of beneficial insects that prey on pests.

Remember to follow pesticide application guidelines carefully and always consult with a pest management professional for tailored advice on your specific situation.
