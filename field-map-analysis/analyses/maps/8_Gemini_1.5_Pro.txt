The pest infestation in your field seems to be localized in a cluster towards the northeast region.  This cluster shows a moderate severity infestation, with a maximum pest count of 10 in a single cell.  While the majority of the field appears pest-free, this concentrated pocket of infestation requires attention.  In total, 31 pests are present across 7 cells in your 6x6 field.  Given the moderate severity, I recommend a moderate pesticide treatment focused on the northeastern quadrant where the cluster is located.  This targeted approach helps control the infestation without subjecting the entire field to unnecessary chemicals.  To prevent future infestations, consider implementing preventative measures such as crop rotation to disrupt pest lifecycles, and introducing natural predators like ladybugs that prey on common crop pests.  Regularly monitor your fields, especially the previously affected area, to allow for early detection and management of any recurring pest issues. The localized nature of this infestation could potentially be related to environmental factors like wind direction or the presence of a nearby host plant attracting pests to that specific area.
