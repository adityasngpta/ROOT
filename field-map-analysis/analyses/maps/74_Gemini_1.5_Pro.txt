The pest infestation in your field appears to be localized to a small cluster in the southeast corner. This suggests a potential point source for the infestation or conditions in that area that are particularly favorable to the pests.  The severity of the infestation is high, with a maximum pest count of 10 in a single cell. The cluster size is small, affecting only 3 cells out of the total 36 in the 6x6 field. However, the total pest count is 26, indicating a potentially significant impact on crop health in the affected area if left untreated. Given the high severity of the infestation, immediate and intensive pesticide treatment is recommended for the affected area in the southeast corner. Consider spot treatments targeting only the infested cells and a small buffer zone around them to maximize efficacy and minimize the impact on the rest of the field. To prevent future infestations, investigate potential causes for this localized outbreak.  Monitor the field closely, particularly the southeast corner and areas with similar environmental conditions, for any signs of recurring infestation. Early detection and proactive management will be crucial in controlling pest populations and ensuring the health of your crops.
