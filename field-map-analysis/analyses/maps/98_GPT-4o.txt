Analyzing the provided matrix of pests in your field, it is evident that there is a significant clustering of pests in the northwest region. This cluster is mainly concentrated in the upper left corner of the field, particularly in the first two rows and columns, where you have counts as high as 10 pests per plant. The highest single-cell pest count is 10, indicating a high severity of infestation. This level of severity warrants immediate and intensive pesticide treatment to curb the spread and mitigate damage to your crops. 

To provide specific numbers, there are a total of 5 cells within the matrix that contain pests, contributing to a combined sum of 25 pests across the entire field. The field size is composed of 7 rows and 5 columns. The primary cluster has both high density and a limited spread, proximate to the field's edge, which is advantageous as it allows for targeted treatment.

Given the high severity in this northwest region, start by applying an intensive pesticide treatment to these specific cells while ensuring that surrounding areas are also monitored and treated as a precaution to stop further spread. Subsequently, the less affected areas of the field, which currently show no significant presence of pests, should be monitored regularly. For these regions, light pesticide treatment may be applied as a preventive measure, alongside the promotion of natural predators which can help in controlling any minor emergent pest populations.

Preventive measures should include regular field inspections, using pheromone traps to monitor pest levels, and ensuring optimal environmental conditions that do not favor pest breeding, such as proper irrigation techniques and crop rotation. Additionally, keeping a rotation of different chemical classes in your pesticide regimes can help prevent pests from developing resistance.

Considering external factors, it would be beneficial to assess if certain environmental factors, such as humidity, adjacent vegetation, or crop type, have been contributing to this localized infestation. Also, since the season might have influenced pest activity, aligning your monitoring and treatment schedules with known pest cycles can improve future pest management strategies. Overall, the focus should be on immediate action in the infested northwest region, coupled with continued vigilance and preventive strategies to safeguard the rest of your field.
