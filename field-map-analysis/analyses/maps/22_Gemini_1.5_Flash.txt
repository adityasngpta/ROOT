The pest infestation in your field is concentrated in the **northeast region**. The highest number of pests is **10** in two cells, one in the second row, fourth column and the other in the third row, fourth column. The **cluster size** is **5** cells, and the **total number of pests** is **34**. This infestation can be classified as **moderate severity** due to the maximum pest count of 10. I recommend a **moderate pesticide treatment** to effectively control the infestation. Given the clustered nature of the infestation, targeted application of the pesticide in the northeast region would be more efficient and minimize potential environmental impact.

You should also consider implementing preventive measures such as crop rotation, maintaining good sanitation practices in your fields, and using pest-resistant varieties. This will help to prevent future infestations. Additionally, regular monitoring of your fields for early signs of pests is crucial. You can use visual inspection, pheromone traps, or other monitoring tools to detect pests in their early stages. Early detection and intervention are critical in managing pest infestations effectively and minimizing crop damage.
