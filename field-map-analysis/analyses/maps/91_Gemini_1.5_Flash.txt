The pest infestation in your field is concentrated in the **northeast region**, with a high density of pests clustered around the top-right corner.  This indicates a potential environmental factor or a point source of infestation in that area. The maximum pest count is **7** found in the second row, third column, signifying a high severity infestation. There are **12** cells with pests, indicating a significant cluster size. The total number of pests in your field is **42**. This analysis suggests the need for immediate and intensive pesticide treatment to effectively control the infestation in this area. 

The field is **7 rows by 5 columns**, with the infestation largely contained within the top three rows.  This suggests a potentially localized issue, and monitoring the spread to the remaining rows should be a priority.  To prevent future infestations, consider implementing preventative measures such as crop rotation, the use of resistant varieties, and maintaining good sanitation practices.  Monitor the field regularly for signs of pest activity, using traps or visual inspections, to detect new infestations early and prevent them from spreading.
