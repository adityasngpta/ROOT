The pest infestation in your field appears to be localized to a small cluster in the southwest region, suggesting a potential point source for the infestation or favorable conditions for the pests in that specific area. The infestation severity is high, with a maximum pest count of 6 in two adjacent cells.  There are only two cells with pests, out of a total of 35 cells in this field (5 rows x 7 columns), resulting in a total of 12 pests.  Given the high severity of the infestation, immediate and intensive pesticide treatment is recommended for the affected area. Consider spot treatments targeting the infested cells and their immediate surroundings to minimize the impact on the rest of the field.  Investigate potential causes for the concentrated infestation in the southwest corner, such as water accumulation, proximity to potential pest harborages, or soil variations. Implement regular monitoring practices, particularly in the area of the previous infestation and surrounding areas, to enable early detection and management of any future outbreaks.  This approach, combining immediate control measures with preventative actions, will help protect your crops from further damage and minimize the risk of future infestations.
