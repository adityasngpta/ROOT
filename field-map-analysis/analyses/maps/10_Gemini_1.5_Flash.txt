The pest infestation in your field is concentrated in the **southeastern region**, specifically in the bottom two rows. This suggests a potential problem with drainage or irrigation in that area, as pests often congregate in moist or waterlogged regions. The **maximum pest count** is **8**, indicating a **high severity** infestation.  The **cluster size** is **4** (number of cells with pests), and the **total number of pests** is **20**. Your field is a **6x6 matrix**, representing a relatively small area.  

Given the high severity of the infestation, I recommend **immediate and intensive pesticide treatment** targeting the southeastern region.  Focus on those two bottom rows, as the highest concentration of pests is located there.  Additionally, consider a **light pesticide treatment** across the entire field to prevent further spread. 

To manage this issue long-term, investigate the drainage and irrigation systems in your field, particularly in the southeastern region. Ensure proper drainage to prevent standing water and optimize water flow. This will help to reduce the conditions that attract pests.  Implement **regular monitoring** and **early detection strategies** to prevent future infestations. Use visual inspection, traps, or pheromone lures to identify any new pest activity. 

By addressing the underlying causes of the infestation and implementing a proactive pest management strategy, you can protect your crop and ensure a healthy yield.
