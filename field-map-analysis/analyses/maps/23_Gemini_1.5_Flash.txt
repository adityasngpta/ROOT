The pest infestation in your field is concentrated in the **center** region. The **maximum pest count** is **8**, found in the second column, fourth row.  The **cluster size** is **7**, representing the number of cells with pests. The **total number of pests** is **33**. Your field is **5 rows by 5 columns**. 

This infestation is considered **high severity** due to the high maximum pest count.  Immediate and intensive pesticide treatment is recommended. The high concentration of pests in the center of the field suggests a potential issue with irrigation, nutrient availability, or other factors impacting the center of the field. Further investigation into these factors would be beneficial to understand the root cause and prevent future infestations. Additionally, monitor the surrounding areas for any signs of pest spread. Employing natural predators or other biological control measures could be explored as a longer-term solution alongside pesticide treatment.
