The field map reveals a highly localized pest infestation in the southeast region of the field. This cluster, characterized by a high density of pests, poses a significant threat to crop health in that specific area. The infestation severity is high, with a maximum pest count of 10 in a single cell. The cluster size is small, spanning only 2 cells. The total number of pests in the field is 20, and the field size is 7 rows by 5 columns.  Immediate and intensive pesticide treatment is strongly recommended for these two cells to rapidly suppress the infestation and prevent further spread. Consider investigating factors specific to the southeast region of your field that might be contributing to this localized outbreak. These could include variations in soil type, irrigation patterns, or proximity to potential pest habitats.  Implementing a comprehensive pest monitoring program, including regular field inspections, will facilitate early detection and timely management of future infestations.
