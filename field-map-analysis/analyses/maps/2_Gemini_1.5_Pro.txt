The pest infestation in your field is concentrated in the northeast corner, exhibiting high severity. This localized outbreak, with a maximum pest count of 7, spans a cluster size of 5 cells. While the total pest count is 14 across your entire field, which measures 7 rows by 5 columns, the concentrated nature of this infestation requires immediate and intensive pesticide treatment in the affected area.  This approach targets the specific area of infestation, maximizing efficacy while minimizing unnecessary pesticide use on the rest of the field.  Consider investigating factors specific to that corner of the field that might be contributing to the infestation, such as water accumulation, potential over fertilization, or the presence of windbreaks that might be influencing pest movement.  For the future, consider implementing regular monitoring and early detection strategies like visual inspections or pheromone traps, particularly in this vulnerable corner, to catch any resurgence or new infestations early on.
