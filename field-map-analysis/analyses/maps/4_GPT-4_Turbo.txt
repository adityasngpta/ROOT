Upon examining the matrix which represents pest counts on different plants in your field, it is clear that there is a localized pest infestation primarily situated in the northwest region of your field. The position of the significant infestation suggests it has not spread to the middle or southern parts of the field, which is somewhat advantageous for containment and treatment.

The matrix indicates that the highest number of pests found on a single plant is 8, which is a considerable infestation on that particular plant. In total, there are four cells (plants) wherein pests are present, bringing the total pest count in the field to 17. The field size is 5 rows by 7 columns, making a total of 35 cells.

Given the high severity of the infestation in one plant (maximum pest count of 8), I recommend immediate intensive pesticide treatment in the northwest corner of the field where these pests are clustered. This targeted approach will help eradicate the infestation before it has the chance to spread further into the field.

For the rest of the field, since pests are absent, preventive measures should be implemented. This could include routine monitoring of pest levels to catch any new infestations early, and the cultivation of natural predators which can help control the pest population organically. Additionally, removing any excess debris or potential breeding grounds near the northwest quadrant can reduce future recurrence of pest build-up.

Keep in mind that environmental factors like moisture, shade, or type of crop grown may have contributed to the pest infestation in the northwest part, so adjusting these parameters could also help mitigate future risks. Regularly scheduled treatments and checks, particularly in the affected area, are advisable to fully control the pest issue. 

Implementing these suggestions should assist in effectively managing the current pest problem and preventing future infestations.
