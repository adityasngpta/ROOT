Examining the field matrix you provided, there is a notable clustering of pests in the northwest region of your field. Specifically, most pests are concentrated at the top left of the matrix with a particularly high count in the second row, first column, where there are 8 pests, which is significantly higher than any other cell in the matrix.

The infestation distribution allows us to define the pest concentration as follows:
- The highest number of pests in a single cell is 8.
- The total number of pest-infested cells (cluster size) is 3, as these are the cells that contain pests.
- The total number of pests summed across the field is 10.

Considering the severity of the infestation, with a maximum pest count of 8 in a single cell, this situation is categorized as high severity. Such a high concentration requires immediate and intensive pesticide treatment. The immediate action should focus on the northwest region of the field, primarily targeting the intensely infested area to stop any further spread to adjacent parts of the field.

We can recommend a couple of measures:
1. Immediate pesticide application should be conducted in the northwest section, with an emphasis on broad-spectrum insecticides known to be effective against the type of pests identified, ensuring thorough coverage of the infested and surrounding area to mitigate the spread.
2. Continuous monitoring should be implemented. After the initial treatment, consistent observation and possible subsequent spot treatments will be essential to manage any resurgence of pest activity effectively.
3. Preventive measures include rotating crops if possible in the subsequent seasons, maintaining proper field hygiene by removing plant debris, and possibly planting pest-resistant crop varieties. These strategies can reduce the occurrence of similar pest infestations in the future.

The field size is 7 rows by 5 columns. Considering the spatial distribution and severity of the pest problem you face, it's crucial to act swiftly and decisively with a rigorous pest management protocol to preserve the health and yield of your crop.
