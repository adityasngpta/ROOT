The pest infestation in your field appears to be concentrated in a cluster located in the **southeast region** of the field. This cluster shows a moderate severity infestation, with the highest single-cell pest count reaching **8**. The cluster size is relatively small, encompassing **7 cells** within the field. Overall, there are **25 pests** present in the entire field, which is **5 rows by 7 columns**.  Given the moderate severity, I recommend a **moderate pesticide treatment** targeting this specific region.  Ensure thorough coverage of the affected area and a buffer zone around the cluster to prevent further spread. It would be beneficial to investigate potential underlying causes for this concentrated infestation. Factors like water availability, soil conditions, or prevailing wind direction in this area might be contributing to the pest concentration. Additionally, consider implementing monitoring strategies like pheromone traps or regular scouting around the perimeter of your field to facilitate early detection of any future outbreaks.
