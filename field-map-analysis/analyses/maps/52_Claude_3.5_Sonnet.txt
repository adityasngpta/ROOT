Based on the provided field map, your pest infestation is concentrated in the center region of your field, forming a distinct cluster. The matrix represents a 5x5 field, with a total of 17 pests distributed across 4 plants. The maximum pest count on a single plant is 5, indicating a moderate severity infestation. The cluster size is relatively small, affecting only 4 out of 25 plants in the field.

Given the centralized nature of this infestation, it appears to be in its early stages and has not yet spread to the outer regions of your field. This presents an opportunity for targeted treatment to prevent further spread. The severity of the infestation is moderate, with a maximum pest count of 5, suggesting the need for a moderate pesticide treatment approach.

To address this pest issue, I recommend applying a moderate-strength pesticide specifically to the central area of your field, focusing on the 2x2 grid where the pests are concentrated. This targeted approach will help minimize pesticide use while effectively addressing the infestation. Additionally, closely monitor the surrounding plants for any signs of pest spread.

As a preventive measure, consider implementing a regular scouting routine, paying particular attention to the center of your field where this infestation originated. This will help you detect future pest problems early. You might also want to investigate why pests are congregating in the center of your field. Factors such as moisture levels, plant variety, or localized environmental conditions could be contributing to this pattern.

To summarize, you're dealing with a centralized, moderate severity pest infestation in your 5x5 field. The maximum pest count is 5, the cluster size is 4 plants, and the total number of pests is 17. By taking prompt action with targeted pesticide application and implementing ongoing monitoring practices, you should be able to effectively manage this pest issue and prevent its spread to the rest of your field.
