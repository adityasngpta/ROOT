The pest infestation in your field is concentrated in the southeast corner.  This localized cluster suggests a potential point source for the infestation or environmental factors favoring pest development in that specific area. The severity of the infestation is high, evidenced by a maximum pest count of 10. The cluster size is relatively small, encompassing 6 cells within the field. However, with a total of 49 pests present, immediate and intensive pesticide treatment is recommended to prevent further spread and potential crop damage. The field size is 6x5. While the localized nature of the infestation is a positive, the high pest density necessitates aggressive control measures.  After treatment, consider investigating potential causes for the southeast corner's susceptibility to pests, such as water accumulation, wind patterns, or proximity to other vegetation that might harbor this pest. Implement a monitoring system for early detection of future infestations, perhaps using pheromone traps or regular visual inspections, focusing on the susceptible area and its surroundings.
