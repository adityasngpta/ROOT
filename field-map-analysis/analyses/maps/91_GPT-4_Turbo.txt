The matrix provided reflects a portion of your field with a varying number of pests across different plants. Analyzing the distribution, we can observe that the infestation is concentrated in the northern section of your field, particularly in the northwest region. The remainder of the field, primarily the southern sections, shows no signs of pest activity.

The highest number of pests in any single cell of the matrix is 7, which indicates an area with potentially severe impact on the crop health. Examining the entire matrix, the locations with pests are the top three rows and the first three columns. No pests are noted beyond this region.

In terms of severity, this infestation would be classified as high given the maximum pest count of 7 in one of the cells. This necessitates immediate and intensive pesticide treatment to mitigate damage and prevent the pests from spreading to other parts of the field.

To quantify the infestation further:
- Maximum pest count is 7.
- Cluster size (number of cells with pests) is 9.
- The total number of pests counted across these cells is 31.
- The field, as represented by the matrix, measures 7 rows by 5 columns.

Considering the severity of the infestation in the northwest portion of the field, it is recommended to apply a targeted, intensive pesticide treatment in this area to quickly reduce the pest population. Given the absence of pests in the majority of the field, preventive measures should be implemented to ensure these pests do not spread. Such measures include routine monitoring, possibly using pest traps or scouting, especially along the current boundary of the infestation.

For pesticide treatment, selecting a product effective against the type of pests identified (not specified here) and appropriate for the crop being cultivated is crucial. Since we are dealing with a high pest density, the pesticide should have a high efficacy rate.

Moreover, examining potential underlying causes for the pest concentration in the northwest could be beneficial. Factors like excessive moisture, type of vegetation, or previous crop waste might contribute to this issue, and addressing these could prevent future outbreaks.

Ultimately, a combination of immediate chemical control in the affected area and preventive strategies across the rest of the field will help maintain the health and yield of your crops while minimizing future pest risks. Regular follow-ups after the initial treatment are advised to assess the effectiveness of the intervention and adjust strategies as necessary.
