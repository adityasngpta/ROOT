Analyzing the provided field matrix, we can identify a localized pest infestation in the southwestern region of the field. The field matrix size is 5 rows by 7 columns. The highest number of pests in any single cell is 7, indicating a point of high severity. Specifically, the most significant pest concentration is located at the coordinate (4,1) in the matrix, with additional infestations around this point at (4,0), (5,0), and (5,1), albeit with lower pest counts of 3 and 5 respectively. 

In total, there are four cells with pest infestations, culminating in a cluster size of 4. The sum of all pests identified in the field is 16. Given the presence of a cell with a pest count of 7, this indicates a high severity of infestation.

For treatment, immediate and intensive pesticide application is recommended, particularly focusing on the southwestern part of the field where the pest numbers are highest. This intensive treatment should aim to eradicate these high-density areas to prevent further spread.

In addition to this targeted pesticide treatment, it is crucial to continually monitor the rest of the field for any signs of the infestation spreading. Preventive measures might include crop rotation, maintaining field hygiene, and encouraging natural predators to keep future pest populations in check. Environmental factors such as moisture levels, temperature variations, and the type of crops planted may also influence pest distribution and should be managed accordingly to reduce the likelihood of future infestations.

In summary, the pest cluster located in the southwestern region of your field suggests severe infestation and requires immediate intensive pesticide treatment. Addressing this promptly will help protect the rest of your field and mitigate potential agricultural losses.
