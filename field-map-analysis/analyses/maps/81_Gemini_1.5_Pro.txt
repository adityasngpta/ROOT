The pest infestation in your field is concentrated in the northeast corner, exhibiting a high level of severity. This is evident from the high concentration of pests in that specific area of the matrix, with the maximum pest count reaching 10. The cluster size, encompassing cells with pests, is relatively small, totaling 7 cells. However, the total number of pests in the field is 33, indicating a significant infestation despite the limited spread. The field size is 7x5, representing rows and columns.  Given the high severity of the infestation, immediate and intensive pesticide treatment is recommended, particularly targeting the northeast corner where the pest concentration is highest.  After addressing this immediate threat, consider implementing preventive measures such as crop rotation or introducing natural predators to avoid future infestations. Regular monitoring and early detection strategies will be crucial in maintaining long-term crop health.  The localized nature of the infestation might be related to environmental factors such as wind direction or the presence of a nearby host plant attracting pests to that particular area of the field.
