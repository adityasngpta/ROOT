This field map indicates a low-severity pest infestation, localized in the **center** region of the field. The maximum pest count is 10, found in a single cell, indicating a limited concentration of pests. The cluster size is 3, with only three cells showing signs of infestation. The total number of pests in the field is 18, indicating a relatively low overall infestation. This field is 5 rows by 7 columns, or 35 cells. This localized infestation suggests a potential issue with a specific environmental factor or a localized introduction of pests in that area. You should focus your treatment efforts on the center region of your field. Given the low severity of the infestation, consider using natural predators or light pesticide treatment to manage the pests in the affected area. You could also introduce beneficial insects or nematodes to control the pest population naturally. As a preventative measure, monitor the field regularly for any new signs of infestation. Focus your monitoring efforts on the central region of the field where the initial infestation was observed. This will help you detect any potential future outbreaks early and prevent them from spreading.
