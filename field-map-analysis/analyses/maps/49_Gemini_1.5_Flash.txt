The pest infestation in your field is concentrated in the southwest region, with a significant cluster of pests located in the bottom left corner. The infestation is categorized as high severity due to the maximum pest count of 7, indicating a dense population of pests in that particular cell. The cluster size spans four cells, with a total of 16 pests across the field. The field size is 5 rows by 7 columns.  Based on the high severity of the infestation, I recommend immediate and intensive pesticide treatment targeting the southwest region, where the majority of the pests are concentrated.  This concentrated approach will effectively target the highest pest density and prevent further spread. To prevent future infestations, it's crucial to implement preventive measures such as rotating crops, maintaining good sanitation practices, and using pest-resistant varieties. Additionally, regular monitoring of the field through visual inspections and traps will allow for early detection and intervention, preventing infestations from escalating to such a high severity level.
