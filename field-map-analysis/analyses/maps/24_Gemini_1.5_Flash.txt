The pest infestation in your field is concentrated in the **northeast** region, with a cluster of high pest counts in the top right corner. The infestation is considered **high severity** based on the maximum pest count of 10 in a single cell. The cluster size, or the number of cells with pests, is 3. The total number of pests in the field is 23. Your field is 5 rows by 7 columns.

The high concentration of pests in the northeast corner suggests a potential issue with the environmental conditions in that specific area. Factors such as wind patterns, soil moisture, or a particular plant variety might be contributing to the localized infestation. Immediate and intensive pesticide treatment is recommended for this high severity infestation. It is crucial to apply the pesticide precisely in the affected area to minimize harm to beneficial insects and the surrounding environment. 

To prevent future infestations, consider implementing preventive measures such as crop rotation, promoting biodiversity, and monitoring for early signs of pests.  Early detection of pests is crucial to manage infestations effectively. Regular field inspections, especially in areas with a history of pest problems, can help identify infestations before they escalate.
