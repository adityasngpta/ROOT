The pest infestation in your field appears to be concentrated in a cluster located in the **northwest** region of the field. This cluster shows a moderate severity of infestation. The highest concentration of pests within this cluster is **10**, indicating a need for **moderate pesticide treatment** to control the infestation promptly.  The cluster itself spans **7 cells** within the field, with a total of **42 pests**  detected across your entire field, which has a size of 6 rows and 6 columns. The localized nature of this cluster suggests a potential environmental factor or a point source that may have contributed to its development. I recommend investigating irrigation patterns, soil conditions, or possible pest entry points on the northwest side of your field.  Regular monitoring of the field, especially around the initial infestation point, is crucial to detect any further spread. Implementing preventive measures such as crop rotation, maintaining field sanitation, and promoting beneficial insect populations can help reduce the risk of future outbreaks.
