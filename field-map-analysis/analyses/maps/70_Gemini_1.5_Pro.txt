The pest infestation in your field is concentrated in the northeast corner, evident by the clusters of 8 and 7 values in the top right of the matrix. This suggests a localized infestation that hasn't spread far. The severity of the infestation is high, considering the maximum pest count is 8.  I recommend immediate and intensive pesticide treatment in the affected area encompassing the top two rows and last two columns of the field. The total number of pests in the field is 15, confined to 3 cells of the matrix, out of a total field size of 7 rows and 7 columns.  Monitor the treated area closely and assess its effectiveness. As a preventive measure, implement regular scouting of your field, especially in areas adjacent to the initial infestation, to ensure early detection of any future outbreaks. This localized outbreak could be due to factors like wind direction carrying pests from a neighboring field or uneven application of pesticides in the past.
