Upon analyzing the provided matrix, which represents a 6x6 field, there is a clear concentration of pests in the central region of the field. The highest pest count in any single cell is 9, indicating that the severity of the infestation is high, particularly because the maximum count of pests exceeds 7 in two cells. The significant pest cluster occupies a total of 7 key cells, specifically centered around the central to southeastern area of the field, with the values as high as 3, 5, 7, and 9. 

The total number of pests across the field sums up to 45, spread over several cells but densely packed in the central to southeastern region. This pattern suggests a severe infestation that could be caused by several factors, including favorable environmental conditions like humidity and temperature, which certain pests thrive in, or possibly due to nutrient-rich plants in the area attracting pests more than others.

Given the high severity of the infestation, immediate and intensive pesticide treatment is recommended. It's crucial to target the centered pest hotspots directly, ensuring thorough coverage to eliminate the majority of the pest population quickly. An intensive pesticide treatment directed at the infested cells (especially those with counts of 9 and 7) will help mitigate the pest impact on crop health. Reevaluate the field conditions to rectify any underlying issues that could be encouraging pest proliferation.

For ongoing management and prevention, consider integrating biological controls by introducing natural predators specific to the pests afflicting the crops, practicing crop rotation to disrupt pest life cycles, and maintaining field hygiene by removing plant residues that often harbor pests. Regular monitoring through traps or periodic field inspections will help detect early signs of pest resurgence for prompt action.

By focusing on immediate intensive treatments followed by prevention and monitoring strategies, you can effectively manage the pest infestation and safeguard your crop yield in both the short term and the long term.
