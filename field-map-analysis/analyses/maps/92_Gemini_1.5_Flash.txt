The pest infestation in your field is concentrated in the **southeastern region** of the field, specifically in the bottom right quadrant. This clustering suggests a potential issue with localized environmental factors or a specific plant variety in that area. The **maximum pest count** is **6**, indicating a **moderate severity** of infestation. The **cluster size**, the number of cells with pests, is **8**, and the **total number of pests** is **26**.  Your field is **6 rows by 6 columns**, which is a relatively small area. Due to the moderate severity, I recommend a **moderate pesticide treatment** targeting the southeast region of the field, focusing on the cells with the highest pest counts.  To prevent future infestations, consider implementing preventative measures such as crop rotation, using pest-resistant varieties, and monitoring for early signs of infestation. You can also introduce natural predators to help control the pest population.  It's essential to continuously monitor the field for any changes in pest distribution and adjust your management strategies accordingly.  By closely observing the spread of pests, you can identify potential sources of infestation and take proactive steps to mitigate further outbreaks.
