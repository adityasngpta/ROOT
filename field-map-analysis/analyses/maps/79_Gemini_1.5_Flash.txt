The field map reveals a concentrated pest infestation in the northwest corner of the field. The highest concentration of pests is located in the top left corner of the field, with a maximum pest count of 8.  This cluster extends into the second row, encompassing a total of 3 cells. The total number of pests in this field is 22. Given the severity of the infestation, with a maximum pest count of 8, immediate and intensive pesticide treatment is recommended to effectively control the spread and minimize crop damage. The infestation appears to be localized, suggesting potential environmental factors or localized planting issues within the northwest corner might be contributing to the pest concentration.  Implementing preventive measures like crop rotation, using resistant varieties, and promoting beneficial insects in the surrounding area could help prevent future infestations. Monitoring for signs of pest activity, especially in the vulnerable northwest corner, is crucial for early detection and targeted treatment.
