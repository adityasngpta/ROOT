The pest infestation in your field is concentrated in the **northeast region** of the field. There's a clear cluster of high pest counts in the top right corner of your 5x5 field. The **maximum pest count** is **10**, indicating a **high severity** of infestation. The **cluster size** is **5 cells**, and the **total number of pests** is **38**. This suggests that while the infestation is concentrated in a specific area, it's affecting a significant portion of that area. The high density of pests in this region could be due to factors such as a favorable microclimate or the presence of a food source that attracts pests. It's essential to take immediate action to control this infestation. Due to the high severity, I recommend an **immediate and intensive pesticide treatment** targeting the northeast region of your field. Additionally, it's crucial to monitor the surrounding areas for potential spread and apply preventive measures like crop rotation or the introduction of natural predators to avoid future infestations.
