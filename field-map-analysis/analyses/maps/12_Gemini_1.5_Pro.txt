The pest infestation in your field appears to be centrally located, forming a distinct cluster in the middle rows of the field.  This suggests a localized source of infestation or favorable conditions for pest development in that specific area.  The severity of the infestation is high, with a maximum pest count of 9 observed in a single cell.  The cluster size, encompassing all cells with pests, is 6 cells, and the total pest count for the entire field is 36.  The field size is 6 rows by 6 columns.

Given the high severity of the infestation, immediate and intensive pesticide treatment is recommended for the affected area in the center of the field.  Focus on the cells with the highest pest counts (3 or more pests per plant) to quickly reduce the population and prevent further spread.  After the initial treatment, continue to monitor the field closely for any signs of resurgence or spread of the infestation.  Investigate potential causes for the centralized infestation, such as soil conditions, irrigation patterns, or nearby host plants, to implement preventive measures against future outbreaks.  Early detection and proactive management are crucial for minimizing crop damage and ensuring a healthy harvest.
