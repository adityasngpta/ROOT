The provided field map shows a clear pest cluster concentrated in the **northwest region** of your field. The maximum pest count is **10**, found in the second row, second column. This high concentration indicates a **high severity** infestation. There are a total of **8 cells** in the matrix with pests, representing a **cluster size** of 8. The **total number of pests** across the field is 44. The field is 5 rows by 5 columns in size.

Due to the high severity of the infestation, an **immediate and intensive pesticide treatment** is recommended to effectively control the pest population.  Target the northwest region with the highest concentration of pests, while also monitoring for potential spread to other areas of the field. The significant cluster in the northwest suggests a potential environmental factor or a localized issue contributing to the infestation. Investigate factors like soil conditions, irrigation, or nearby vegetation that could attract pests to this specific area.

For future pest management, consider implementing preventive measures such as crop rotation, maintaining good sanitation practices, and encouraging natural pest predators. Regularly monitor your field for early signs of infestation and promptly address any detected issues to prevent further spread and maintain crop health.
