The pest infestation in your field appears to be localized to a small cluster slightly southwest of the center. This cluster is characterized by a relatively high concentration of pests, with the highest count reaching 7.  While the overall infestation appears to be relatively small, the presence of these pests in close proximity could pose a moderate risk to your crop. I recommend a moderate pesticide treatment targeting this specific area to prevent further spread and minimize crop damage. The maximum pest count in a single cell is 7, and the cluster size is 3 cells. The total pest count in the field is 19, and the field size is 7x5.  Regular monitoring of the field is recommended to track the effectiveness of the treatment and to identify any potential new infestations. This localized infestation could be due to factors such as wind direction, proximity to another infested field, or even variations in soil conditions within your field.  By understanding the distribution and potential causes, you can implement more targeted and effective pest management strategies in the future.
