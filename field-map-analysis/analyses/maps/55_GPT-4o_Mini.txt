The matrix you provided indicates the distribution of pests across a 6-row by 5-column field, with certain areas experiencing significant pest concentrations. Notably, the maximum pest count in a single cell is 10, found in both the (2,0) and (3,0) positions, marking these locations as high-intensity clusters. Overall, the cluster size consists of 12 cells that have recorded pest counts, indicating an active infestation across multiple areas. The total number of pests in the field sums up to 55, suggesting that this is a substantial risk to crop health.

Analyzing the spatial arrangement of these pest counts, we can observe that the most affected areas are concentrated towards the western side (specifically in the southeast and southwest quadrants of the field), which could indicate a possible vector or environmental factor that is promoting this infestation. Given the maximum pest count of 10, this situation qualifies as a high-severity infestation.

As such, immediate and intensive pesticide treatment is recommended to mitigate further damage. In addition to applying chemical treatments, it would also be prudent to examine underlying factors contributing to this pest concentrationâ€”such as moisture levels, plant health, and surrounding environmental conditions. Preventive measures should include regularly scheduled monitoring of pest populations, enhancing biodiversity to include natural predators, and implementing crop rotation in future planting cycles to disrupt pest lifecycle continuity. Through these approaches, you can manage the current pest challenge effectively while laying the groundwork for long-term pest control strategies.
