Upon analyzing the provided field matrix, it becomes clear that the pest infestation is concentrated in a specific region of the field. The matrix is a 5x7 grid where each number denotes the count of pests on a particular plant. Notably, the majority of the field (especially the upper three-quarters) has zero pest counts, indicating no significant pest activity in those areas. The pest presence is confined to the lower right corner of the matrix, particularly in the last two rows and the last three columns. The highest pest counts are recorded at the cell (3, 6) with 6 pests, the cell (4, 5) with 4 pests, the cell (4, 6) with 2 pests, and a moderate count of 3 pests at cell (3, 5).

Given the pest distribution, we can categorize the cluster location as being in the southeast region of your field. The severity of the infestation is moderate since the maximum pest count in a single cell is 6, which is less than the high severity threshold of 7. However, it's crucial to manage this swiftly to prevent further spread. 

For treatment, I recommend a moderate pesticide intervention focused on the southeast corner of the field. Apply the pesticide uniformly over the affected cells, making sure to cover the immediate surrounding areas as a preventive buffer. Additionally, consider integrating natural predators that are effective in controlling these pests, which can help in maintaining the pest population at manageable levels without extensive chemical use.

Regarding the field metrics, the cluster size involves 3 cells with pests, making it a localized but manageable issue. The total number of pests across the field adds up to 15, from which the pest counts are relatively contained in one area. The overall field size is 5 rows by 7 columns.

To prevent future outbreaks, it is beneficial to continuously monitor pest levels across the field using traps or regular inspections. Also, consider crop rotation practices and maintaining healthy soil conditions to deter pest colonization. Environmental factors such as moisture levels and temperature may also influence pest proliferation, so understanding these can aid in preventive measures and early detection of potential infestations.

By focusing your attention on the southeast corner urgently, while keeping an eye on overall field health, you can effectively control the current pest issue and minimize the risk of future infestations.
