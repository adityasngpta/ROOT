The pest infestation in your field is concentrated in the **center** region, specifically the middle three cells of the second and third rows. This cluster indicates a localized, moderate infestation. The maximum number of pests observed in any single cell is 5, indicating a moderate severity level. The cluster size is 3 cells, meaning the infestation affects a relatively small area of your field. The total number of pests observed is 17. 

Despite the moderate severity, the concentrated nature of the infestation suggests the potential for rapid spread if left untreated. Since the maximum pest count is 5, we recommend a moderate pesticide treatment targeting the center region of the field, focusing on the second and third rows. You could also consider utilizing natural predators or beneficial insects to help control the population in a more environmentally friendly approach.  

It's important to monitor the field regularly for signs of spreading or increased pest activity. Early detection and intervention are crucial to prevent the infestation from becoming more severe. Consider implementing preventative measures in the future, such as crop rotation or the use of pest-resistant varieties, to minimize the risk of future infestations.
