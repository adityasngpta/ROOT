The field map indicates a localized pest infestation concentrated in the northwest region of your field. The highest concentration of pests is in the top left cell with a maximum pest count of 10. There are a total of 3 cells with pests, indicating a small cluster size. The total number of pests in the field is 24, with the majority found in the northwest corner. This suggests a potential localized issue, perhaps due to environmental factors or a point source of infestation. Given the high maximum pest count of 10, the severity of the infestation is considered high. Therefore, immediate and intensive pesticide treatment is recommended to effectively control the pest population. The field size is 7 rows by 5 columns.  It is important to monitor the field closely in the coming days and weeks to ensure the infestation is fully eradicated and to prevent future outbreaks. Consider using preventive measures such as crop rotation, maintaining proper sanitation, and implementing early detection methods to reduce the risk of future infestations.
