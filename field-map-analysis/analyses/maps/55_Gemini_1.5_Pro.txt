The pest infestation in your field appears to be concentrated in the northwest region, indicating a localized cluster rather than a widespread problem.  This pattern could suggest an external factor, such as wind direction or proximity to another infested field, might have driven the pests toward this specific area. The infestation severity is high, with a maximum pest count of 10 in some areas. The cluster size is relatively small, affecting approximately 8 cells out of the total 35 cells in your field. There is a total of 47 pests present.  Given the high severity of the infestation in this localized area, immediate and intensive pesticide treatment is recommended for the affected northwest quadrant of your field. This targeted approach will effectively address the cluster while minimizing the impact on the rest of the crop and beneficial insects.  After treatment, closely monitor the treated area for any signs of resurgence or pest movement.  Consider implementing preventive measures, such as barrier crops or pheromone traps, around the perimeter of your field to deter future pest incursions.
