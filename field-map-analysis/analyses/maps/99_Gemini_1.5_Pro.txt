The pest infestation in your field appears to be localized to a small cluster in the northwest corner. This cluster is characterized by a relatively high concentration of pests, with a maximum pest count of 8 in a single cell. The infestation is confined to only two cells, indicating a small cluster size.  The total number of pests in the entire field is 9, suggesting a low overall pest pressure. However, the localized nature of the infestation, particularly the high concentration in the northwest corner, points to a potentially emerging issue. Given the relatively low overall pest pressure and small cluster size, a light pesticide treatment targeting the affected area in the northwest corner might be sufficient.  Alternatively, consider introducing natural predators of the pest in this area. Monitor the area closely for any signs of spreading.  As a preventative measure, inspect your field regularly for early signs of pest infestations. Pay attention to environmental factors such as temperature and humidity, as these can influence pest development and spread. The field size is 7 rows by 5 columns.
