Examining the matrix you provided, which represents the distribution of pests in your field, it's clear that the pest concentration is primarily located in the southeast region of the field. This is evident as the highest pest counts (with numbers reaching up to 10) are found in the bottom right corner of the matrix.

The severity of this infestation can be classified as high, given that the maximum pest count in a single cell is 10. This suggests an immediate need for intensive pest management strategies.

Specifically:
- The field size is 7 rows by 5 columns.
- The highest number of pests in a single cell (maximum pest count) is 10.
- To determine the cluster size, or the number of cells that have pests, we observe 9 cells in total that have pests, ranging from counts of 1 to 10.
- The total number of pests across the matrix sums up to 59.

Given the high density of pests in the southeast corner, it is imperative to focus your treatment efforts in that area. Immediate and intensive pesticide treatment is recommended. This could involve the application of broad-spectrum insecticides to quickly reduce pest numbers. Additionally, given the concentration of pests, it would be useful to implement a localized treatment protocol focusing on the infested cells to eliminate the possibility of the pests spreading further into the field.

Preventative measures should also be considered to avoid future infestations. This may include regular monitoring of the field with pest traps and periodic inspections, especially focusing on the southeast region where infestation was most intense. Adjustments in irrigation or soil amendments might also help in discouraging pest re-establishment.

Furthermore, consider crop rotation or the introduction of pest-resistant plant varieties in future planting seasons to decrease vulnerability to similar pest attacks. Recording pest outbreaks and treatment effectiveness can also guide future pest management strategies.

Lastly, the underlying causes of such heavy pest concentration in the southeast might be due to several factors including localized higher moisture content, shade, or wind-protection in that sector, making it a favorable environment for pests. Addressing these environmental factors can reduce future risks.
