The pest infestation in your field appears to be concentrated in the northwest corner, suggesting a localized source or attractive factor in that area.  The infestation severity is high, with a maximum pest count of 8 in one cell.  There are only 2 cells with pests present, indicating a very small cluster size, and a total of 15 pests in the entire field. The field size is 5 columns by 7 rows. Given the high severity, immediate and intensive pesticide treatment is recommended for the affected area. However, due to the very limited cluster size, a highly targeted application to only the affected plants, rather than the entire field, would be the most efficient approach.  Consider investigating the affected area for potential causes such as diseased plants, excess moisture, or the presence of attracting debris.  Monitoring surrounding plants for signs of spreading is crucial, along with implementing preventative measures like removing plant debris, ensuring good airflow, and potentially introducing natural predators to keep future infestations in check.
