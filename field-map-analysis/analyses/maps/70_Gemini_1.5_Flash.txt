The pest infestation in your field is concentrated in the **northeast region** of the field, specifically in the top right corner. This suggests a possible cause could be an environmental factor influencing this area, like a lack of sunlight or wind exposure. The infestation is considered **high severity** due to the **maximum pest count of 8** in a single cell, with a **cluster size of 3 cells** (the cells with 8, 7, and 7 pests) and a **total of 23 pests** across the field. The field itself is 5 rows by 7 columns, making it a 5x7 matrix. Given the high severity of the infestation, immediate and intensive pesticide treatment is recommended to effectively control the pests. You may also consider targeting the northeast corner specifically with a higher concentration of pesticide. However, ensure to follow safety guidelines and use environmentally friendly options whenever possible. As a preventive measure, consider implementing strategies to improve airflow and sunlight penetration in the northeast region of the field to discourage future infestations. Regular monitoring of this area is critical to detect early signs of pest resurgence and implement control measures promptly.
