The pest infestation in your field appears to be localized to a small cluster in the northwest region. This cluster is characterized by a relatively low number of pests, with a maximum pest count of 9 in a single cell.  The total number of infested cells is 3, and the total pest count for the entire field is 18. Given the field size of 7 rows and 5 columns, this infestation is considered low severity. While the current infestation appears minimal, the presence of pests warrants attention to prevent further spread. I recommend a light pesticide treatment or consider introducing natural predators to the affected area.  This approach targets the localized infestation without unnecessary pesticide use on the rest of the field.  Continue monitoring the field for any changes in pest distribution or increases in pest counts, as this will help inform adjustments to your management strategy and ensure early detection of potential outbreaks.
