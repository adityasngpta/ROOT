The provided matrix reveals significant pest concentrations in the lower section of your field, particularly in the last three rows. The high numbers of pests are primarily clustered towards the center and northeastern quadrant, with the maximum count reaching 7 pests in multiple cells. Specifically, the cells at positions (5,4), (6,3), (6,4), and (6,5) indicate that the southeast region of your field houses the most substantial infestations. Given that the highest number of pests in a single cell is 7, this indicates a high severity level of infestation, as it meets the threshold you have established.

In terms of pest distribution, the matrix shows a cluster size of 5 cells that contain pests, contributing to a total of 28 pests across the field. The overall field size is 7 rows by 5 columns, highlighting concentrated pest activity in a specific area of your field a relative to the otherwise pest-free zones. This cluster pattern could point to a localized source of infestation, possibly influenced by factors such as moisture levels, crop type, or seasonal changes that favor pest proliferation.

Given the high severity of the infestation, I recommend implementing immediate and intensive pesticide treatment in the affected areas. Targeting the cells in the southeast region specifically will help mitigate further spread of these pests. Additionally, consider integrating natural predators or biological controls in the long term to manage pest populations sustainably. It’s also essential to adopt preventive measures—monitoring for early detection of pests and implementing crop rotation or intercropping strategies can significantly lower the risk of future infestations. Ensuring that crop health is maintained through nutrient management may also reduce susceptibility to pest attacks.
