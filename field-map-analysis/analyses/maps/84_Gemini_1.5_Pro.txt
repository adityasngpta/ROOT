The pest infestation in your field appears to be concentrated in the northwest corner, indicating a localized cluster.  This suggests a potential point source for the infestation or conditions in that area that are more favorable to the pests.  The severity of the infestation is moderate, with a maximum pest count of 10 in a single cell. The total cluster size is 9 cells with a total of 28 pests across your entire field. Your field is 7 rows by 5 columns. I recommend a moderate pesticide treatment focused on the northwest corner of the field to effectively target the infestation.  Consider investigating the potential cause of the concentrated infestation in that area - are there environmental factors at play (e.g., water accumulation, shade) or could the pests be spreading from a nearby source?  Regular monitoring of the entire field, especially the previously infested area, will be crucial to detect any resurgence or spread of the pests.
