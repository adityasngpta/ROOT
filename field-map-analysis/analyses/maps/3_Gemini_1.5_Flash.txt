The pest infestation in your field is concentrated in the **southeast** region, specifically in the bottom two rows and the middle three columns. The cluster size is 5 cells, with a maximum pest count of 8 in a single cell. The total number of pests in the field is 27. The infestation is of **moderate severity** due to the maximum pest count being 8, which falls within the range of 4 to 7. Based on this, I recommend a moderate pesticide treatment targeting the southeast region, focusing on the three middle columns of the bottom two rows. 

While the infestation is currently localized, it's essential to monitor for potential spread to adjacent areas, particularly in the southern and eastern directions. Preventive measures like crop rotation, ensuring healthy plant growth, and using natural predators could help limit future infestations. Consider implementing a regular monitoring program, potentially using traps or visual inspections, to detect early signs of pest activity. The observed localized infestation could be linked to specific factors like soil conditions or microclimate variations within the southeast region.
