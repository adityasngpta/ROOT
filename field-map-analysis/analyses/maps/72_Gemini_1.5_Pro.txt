The pest infestation in your field appears to be concentrated in a distinct cluster located in the **northwest** region of the field. This cluster represents a **moderate** severity infestation, with a maximum pest count of **10** observed in several cells within the cluster. The cluster itself spans **8** cells, indicating a localized infestation. In total, there are **47** pests present across your entire field, which consists of 7 rows and 5 columns. 

Given the moderate severity and localized nature of this infestation, a targeted approach using moderate pesticide treatment is recommended. Focus application on the affected northwest region to effectively control the cluster while minimizing the impact on the rest of the field. Consider investigating potential causes for this localized infestation, such as the presence of favorable environmental conditions or the movement of pests from adjacent areas. Implementing monitoring systems, such as pheromone traps, in and around your field will enable early detection of any future pest activity, allowing for timely intervention.
