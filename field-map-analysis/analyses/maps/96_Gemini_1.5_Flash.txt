The pest infestation in your field is concentrated in the southwest region, specifically clustering around the bottom left corner. This suggests a potential issue with drainage or soil conditions in that area, leading to a higher concentration of pests. The infestation is considered high severity, with a maximum pest count of 9 in a single cell. This indicates a significant presence of pests and the need for immediate action. There are a total of 9 cells affected by pests, indicating a cluster size of 9. The total number of pests in the field sums up to 35. The field size is 5 rows by 5 columns. Due to the high severity of the infestation, immediate and intensive pesticide treatment is recommended to effectively control the pest population. Consider using a broad-spectrum insecticide that targets the specific pest species identified. It is important to follow label instructions carefully for proper application and safety. Additionally, monitor the field closely for any signs of re-infestation after treatment.  To prevent future infestations, consider implementing preventive measures such as crop rotation, proper irrigation practices, and maintaining healthy soil conditions. Regularly monitor your field for early signs of pests, which will allow for a timely and efficient response.
