The pest infestation in your field appears to be highly localized and concentrated in the northwest region of the field. This cluster, while small, exhibits a high severity infestation. The maximum pest count is 8, found in a single cell within this cluster. There are a total of 3 cells with pests, and 15 pests are present in the entire field. The field size is 6 rows by 6 columns. Due to the high severity of the infestation (max pest count >= 7), immediate and intensive pesticide treatment is recommended for the affected area.  Consider spot treatments targeting only the infested cells and their immediate surroundings to minimize the impact on the rest of the field and beneficial insects. It's important to investigate potential causes for this clustered infestation. Factors like the presence of a favorable microclimate, susceptible plant varieties in that area, or the movement patterns of pest insects could contribute to such a distribution.  Monitoring the rest of the field for any signs of spread is crucial. Implementing preventative measures like crop rotation, introducing natural predators, and maintaining good field sanitation will help avoid future outbreaks.
