The pest infestation in your field is concentrated in the **southwestern region**, specifically within the middle rows and leftmost columns.  The highest concentration of pests is located in the cell at row 3, column 2, with a maximum pest count of 10. This indicates a **high severity** of infestation.  The cluster size, defined as the number of cells containing pests, is 7. The total number of pests across the field is 30.  The field size is 7 rows by 5 columns.  Given the high density of pests in the southwest region and the high maximum pest count, immediate and intensive pesticide treatment is recommended for this area.  Consider using a broad-spectrum insecticide effective against the specific pest species.  

To prevent future infestations, consider implementing preventative measures like crop rotation, using resistant varieties, and maintaining good sanitation practices to minimize pest attractants.  For early detection, regularly scout the field, focusing on areas with a history of pest activity.  This infestation could be linked to factors such as wind direction,  crop type, or soil conditions.  Further investigation into the specific pest species and its lifecycle can help pinpoint the root cause and guide future treatment strategies.
