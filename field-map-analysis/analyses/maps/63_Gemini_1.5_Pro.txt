The pest infestation in your field appears to be concentrated in the northeast region, indicating a localized cluster. This suggests a potential point source for the infestation or environmental factors favoring pest development in that specific area. The severity of the infestation is high, evidenced by a maximum pest count of 10 in a single cell.  With 7 cells registering pest presence, immediate and intensive pesticide treatment is recommended to control the outbreak swiftly and prevent further spread. The total pest count in your field is 29, indicating a substantial infestation despite its localized nature. Your field size is 5 rows by 5 columns.  After the initial treatment, consider follow-up monitoring and spot treatments to address any lingering pests. To prevent future infestations, investigate potential causes such as pest migration patterns, favorable breeding grounds in the northeast region, or crop susceptibility in that area. Implementing preventive measures like crop rotation, introducing natural predators, and maintaining field sanitation can contribute to long-term pest management.
