The pest infestation in your field exhibits a distinct pattern concentrated in the northwest region, specifically in the first three rows and columns. The highest number of pests is found in the top right corner of this cluster, with a maximum pest count of 10. This suggests a high severity infestation, requiring immediate and intensive pesticide treatment. The cluster size, encompassing cells with pests, is 11, indicating a significant portion of the field is affected. The total number of pests across the field sums to 43, highlighting the substantial impact on your crop. Given the localized nature of the infestation, you can focus your treatment efforts on the northwest region, minimizing the use of pesticides in other unaffected areas. This targeted approach helps protect beneficial insects and the environment while effectively controlling the infestation. 

To prevent future infestations, consider implementing integrated pest management strategies such as crop rotation, maintaining healthy soil, and utilizing natural predators. Monitoring the field regularly for signs of pests will help you detect and treat infestations early, minimizing their impact on your crop.
