The pest infestation in your field is concentrated in the northwest corner, evident by the cluster of high pest numbers. This suggests a localized source of infestation or favorable conditions for the pests in that specific area. The severity of the infestation is high, considering the maximum pest count reaches 10.  I recommend immediate and intensive pesticide treatment in the affected area encompassing the top three rows and three columns to rapidly reduce the pest population.  The total number of pests is 39, with 7 cells showing infestation in your field size of 5 rows and 7 columns. Monitor the effectiveness of the treatment and consider spot treatments if necessary.  To prevent future infestations, investigate potential causes such as the presence of pest harborages,  favorable microclimates in the northwest corner, or the movement patterns of pests in your area. Implement preventive measures like early pest detection through regular scouting, removing potential harborages, and using pest-resistant crop varieties.
