The matrix you've provided shows pest infestation concentrated primarily in the northwest region of the field. Notable pest counts appear in the top left corner, indicating a localized pest cluster predominantly affecting a limited portion of your crops.

Upon analyzing the specifics of your matrix:
- The maximum number of pests found in any single cell is 10.
- There are 4 cells with pests, making this the size of the pest cluster.
- The total number of pests across the entire field is 32.

Given the field size of 5 rows and 5 columns, the resting majority of your field appears to be pest-free indicating the infestation is currently localized but poses a risk of spreading if not managed correctly.

The severity of the infestation can be classified as high since the maximum pest count in a single cell exceeds 7. This situation calls for immediate and intensive pesticide treatment, specifically in the northwest area of your field where the pest numbers are highest. Consider using a broad-spectrum insecticide that targets the specific type of pests identified, ensuring application follows ecological guidelines to prevent any harmful environmental impact. 

It's also crucial to monitor the entire field regularly, with special attention to adjacent areas to the northwest region to catch and mitigate any spread early. For preventive measures, introducing practices such as crop rotation, maintaining field hygiene by removing plant residues, and using barrier crops can help reduce future infestations.

Additionally, consider integrating biological control methods by introducing natural predators of the pests into the field; this is a sustainable approach that helps maintain ecological balance. Documenting this infestation and the treatments applied will also aid in developing a more informed pest management strategy for future seasons.

Overall, quick action is needed to address the high severity of infestation in the northwest to safeguard your crops and ensure the health of the larger field.
