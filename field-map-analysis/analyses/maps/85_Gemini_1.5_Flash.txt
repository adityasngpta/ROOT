The pest infestation in your field is concentrated in the northwest region, specifically in the top two rows and leftmost two columns. The maximum pest count is 10, indicating a moderate level of infestation. The cluster size is 4, suggesting a localized concentration of pests. The total number of pests in the field is 32. This infestation is concentrated in the northwest corner, suggesting potential underlying causes like wind direction carrying pests or uneven irrigation practices affecting the vulnerability of plants in that area. Although the infestation is moderate in severity, immediate action is recommended to prevent further spread and minimize crop damage. A moderate pesticide treatment targeting the northwest region is advised, focusing on the cells with the highest pest counts. Implementing preventive measures such as regular field inspections, monitoring for early signs of infestation, and implementing practices that discourage pest attraction, like proper irrigation and weed control, are crucial for long-term pest management.
