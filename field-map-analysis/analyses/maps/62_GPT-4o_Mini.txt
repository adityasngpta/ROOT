Upon analyzing the provided matrix, we can observe the distribution of pests across your field, represented as follows:

```
5 5 6 0 0 0 0
3 10 5 0 0 0 0
5 1 2 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0
```

In this 5-row by 7-column matrix, the highest concentration of pests is located in the northwest section, particularly at the cell (1, 1) which contains a pest count of 10. This represents the maximum pest count in this matrix. The total number of pests across the field totals 43, which is derived from the sum of all cells containing pests. The cluster size, or the number of cells with pest counts, is 10, indicating that pest presence is relatively concentrated within a limited area of the field.

Based on the highest pest count of 10, which is classified as high severity, immediate and intensive pesticide treatment is recommended to mitigate the risk of crop damage and pest spread. This treatment should focus on the northwest region of the field where the pest population is densest. Additionally, consistent monitoring of these areas will be crucial in managing the infestation effectively. After the initial treatment, consider implementing integrated pest management strategies, such as introducing natural predators or using traps, particularly in regions where pest counts remain elevated post-treatment.

For preventive measures, ensure proper crop rotation and diversity in planting, as monocultures often attract pests. Regularly inspect plants for signs of infestation, and consider establishing a scheduled monitoring plan, particularly during vulnerable growth stages. Environmental factors such as moisture levels and temperature may also contribute to pest outbreaks, so maintaining healthy soil and optimal irrigation practices will further help reduce susceptibility to future infestations. Overall, taking immediate action and adapting long-term strategies will enhance crop resilience against pest pressures.
