The pest infestation in your field is concentrated in the **northeast** region, specifically in the second and third rows, third column. This suggests a possible localized environmental factor impacting this area, such as a specific soil condition or microclimate.  The **maximum pest count** is 8, indicating a **high severity** infestation. The **cluster size** is 3, encompassing the three cells with pests. The **total number of pests** is 17. Your field size is 5 rows by 5 columns. Given the high severity of the infestation, immediate and intensive pesticide treatment is recommended. This treatment should target the northeast region, focusing on the cells with the highest pest density. Additionally, consider employing preventive measures to mitigate future infestations. This might include targeted soil amendments in the northeast region, adjusting irrigation practices, and monitoring the area for early signs of pest activity.
