The pest infestation in your field is concentrated in the northwest region, with a cluster of pests present in the top left corner. The highest number of pests found in a single cell is 8, indicating a high severity of infestation. The cluster size is 3, meaning 3 cells in the matrix contain pests. The total number of pests across the field is 23, with a field size of 5 rows and 7 columns. Due to the high severity of infestation, an immediate and intensive pesticide treatment is recommended to effectively control the pest population. 

The spatial distribution suggests that the pests may have entered the field from the northwest direction, potentially due to wind or proximity to an infested area. To prevent future infestations, consider implementing preventive measures such as border treatments, monitoring for early signs of pest activity, and rotating crops to disrupt pest cycles. You can also consider using natural predators or beneficial insects to help control the pest population in the future.
