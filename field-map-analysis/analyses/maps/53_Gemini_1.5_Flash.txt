The pest infestation in your field is concentrated in the northwest region, specifically in the top three rows. This suggests a potential environmental factor, such as wind direction or localized water source, may be contributing to the uneven distribution. The infestation is classified as moderate severity, with a maximum pest count of 9, indicating a significant presence of pests in the northwest corner. The cluster size encompasses 9 cells, with a total of 30 pests across the field. The field size is 5 rows by 7 columns. 

Given the moderate severity of the infestation, we recommend a moderate pesticide treatment focused on the northwest region, where the majority of pests are concentrated. This targeted approach will help to control the infestation while minimizing the impact on beneficial insects and the overall ecosystem.  

To prevent future infestations, consider implementing preventive measures such as crop rotation, using pest-resistant varieties, and maintaining good sanitation practices in the field.  Early detection is crucial for controlling pests. Regularly inspect your crops for signs of infestation and implement appropriate control measures promptly. This proactive approach will help to minimize the impact of pests on your crop yields.
