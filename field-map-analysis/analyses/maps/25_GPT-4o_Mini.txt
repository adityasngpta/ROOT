The matrix representing pest populations in your field is structured as follows:

```
0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0
1 8 5 0 0
1 8 4 0 0
5 10 1 0 0
```

Analyzing the matrix reveals significant spatial insights into the distribution of the pests. The highest concentration of pests is located predominantly in the southeast region of the field, with a maximum pest count of 10 in the cell at position (4,2). This area also shows a strong cluster of pests in adjacent cells, indicating a localized infestation that warrants immediate attention. The infestation severity is classified as high due to the maximum pest count being 10, which exceeds the threshold of 7 for intensive treatment.

In total, the matrix reveals 11 cells containing pest populations, resulting in a cluster size of 11, while the total number of pests across the entire field amounts to 38. The field dimensions indicate that it has 5 rows and 5 columns. Given the high severity of this infestation, I strongly recommend an immediate and intensive pesticide treatment in the affected southeastern region and surrounding areas. 

In addition to immediate treatment, consider implementing preventive measures to avoid future infestations. This can include crop rotation, maintaining healthy soil practices, and introducing natural predators to establish a balanced ecosystem. To monitor pest populations effectively, regular scouting and the use of pest traps can aid in early detection, allowing for timely interventions before infestations become severe. By taking these actions, you can protect your crop health and mitigate the risks associated with pest damage.
