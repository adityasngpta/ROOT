The pest infestation in your field is concentrated in the **center** region, specifically around the middle three columns and rows. This infestation can be classified as moderate severity, with a maximum pest count of 8 in a single cell. There are a total of 9 cells with pests, indicating a cluster size of 9. The total number of pests in the field is 35. Your field is 6 rows by 6 columns in size.  

The infestation exhibits a pattern of higher concentration in the center, suggesting a potential issue with the central part of the field, perhaps a microclimate variation, or uneven soil conditions.  It is recommended to apply a moderate pesticide treatment to the central region of the field, focusing on the area with the highest pest counts.  This treatment should help manage the existing infestation and prevent its spread.  To prevent future infestations, consider implementing preventive measures like crop rotation, maintaining good sanitation practices, and monitoring the field regularly for early signs of pest activity.
