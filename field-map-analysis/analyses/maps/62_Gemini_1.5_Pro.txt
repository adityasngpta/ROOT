The pest infestation in your field is concentrated in the northwest corner, indicating a localized cluster. This suggests a potential point source for the infestation or more favorable conditions for the pests in that specific area.  The severity of the infestation is high, as the maximum pest count is 10.  I recommend immediate and intensive pesticide treatment in the affected area (the top left corner of the field) to prevent the infestation from spreading. The total number of pests in the field is 29, spread across 6 cells in your 5x7 field.  Consider investigating factors specific to the northwest corner of your field that might be attracting pests or making that area more suitable for them. This could include factors like microclimate variations, soil type differences, nearby host plants, or potential entry points for pests.  In the future, implement regular monitoring and early detection strategies, such as scouting and pheromone traps, to identify pest pressure early on. This will allow you to take timely action and potentially avoid large-scale infestations requiring intensive pesticide applications.
