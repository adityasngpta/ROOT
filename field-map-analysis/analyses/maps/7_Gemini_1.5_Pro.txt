The pest infestation in your field appears to be highly localized in the northwest corner, indicating a potential early-stage infestation or a point source for the pest. The infestation severity is low, with a maximum pest count of 7 in a single cell. The total cluster size is small, affecting only 2 cells out of the total 35 in your field.  Given the low severity but concentrated nature of the infestation, a light pesticide treatment targeting the affected area might be sufficient to control the spread. Alternatively, consider introducing natural predators of the pest in this area to control the population. It's important to continue monitoring the field for any signs of spread. The localized nature of the infestation suggests potential causes like a nearby infested area, specific environmental conditions favoring the pest in that corner, or even the movement of contaminated equipment.
