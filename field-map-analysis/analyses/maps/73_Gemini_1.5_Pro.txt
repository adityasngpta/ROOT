The pest infestation in your field is concentrated in the southeast corner, representing a high severity infestation. This is evident from the high pest counts in that area, with a maximum pest count of 10. The cluster size is relatively small, with only 3 cells reporting pests, out of a total field size of 5 rows and 7 columns. However, the total number of pests, 24, is significant given the concentrated nature of the infestation.  Given the high severity of the infestation, immediate and intensive pesticide treatment is recommended for the affected area in the southeast corner of the field. This targeted approach will help to quickly reduce the pest population and minimize damage to the surrounding crop. Additionally, consider implementing a monitoring system to enable early detection of future pest outbreaks. This could involve regular scouting of the field or the use of pest traps. Understanding the environmental factors and farming practices that might have contributed to this localized infestation could help in developing preventative measures for the future.
