The field matrix representing pest counts is as follows: 

```
9 2 5 0 0 0 0
10 6 10 0 0 0 0
5 10 9 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0
```

Upon analysis, the highest pest count is 10, located at the cells (1, 1) and (2, 2), indicating substantial clusters at the northwest portion of the field. The pest distribution is concentrated in the upper left corner of the matrix, where the majority of pests are found. The total number of cells with pests (cluster size) is 10, and the sum of all pests across the field (total number of pests) is 70. Given the maximum pest count of 10, this infestation severity is classified as high. 

To manage this infestation effectively, I recommend immediate and intensive pesticide treatment. This should involve a systematic application of a suitable broad-spectrum pesticide targeting the specific type of pests identified. Consider targeting the areas most affected, particularly around the cells containing the maximum counts, while ensuring proper safety measures for application.

In terms of spatial distribution, the infestation is primarily localized in the northwest regions of the field, suggesting that either environmental factors, such as moisture accumulation or shade, may be contributing to pest proliferation. Monitoring these areas closely is crucial, and preventative measures such as crop rotation and enhancing soil health can help deter future infestations. Also, consider implementing integrated pest management practices, including using natural predators, to sustain lower pest levels and prevent any resurgence.

Lastly, it is vital to maintain a regular monitoring schedule, using traps and visual inspections to detect pests early. This will allow for timely interventions before infestations reach critical levels. Given the data and current conditions from this season, your primary focus should be on addressing the identified pest clusters with stringent control measures while preparing for future pest management strategies.
