The pest infestation in your field appears to be localized to a small cluster in the southwest region. This cluster is characterized by a relatively high density of pests, with a maximum pest count of 10 in two adjacent cells.  Despite the high concentration in this small area, the overall infestation severity could be considered moderate given the maximum pest count of 10 is above 4. The total number of pests in the field is 27, spread across only 2 cells out of the total 36 cells in the field (6 rows x 6 columns).  I would recommend a moderate pesticide treatment targeted at the southwestern region of your field where the cluster is located.  This targeted approach will help control the infestation while minimizing the impact on beneficial insects and the surrounding environment. Consider investigating potential underlying causes for this localized infestation, such as poor drainage or the presence of crop debris that might attract pests to this specific area.  For the future, implement a regular monitoring program to detect pest activity early on. This could involve visual inspections of the field or the use of pest traps. Early detection allows for timely intervention and prevents widespread infestations.
