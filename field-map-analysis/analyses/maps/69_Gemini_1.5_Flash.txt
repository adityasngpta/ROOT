The pest infestation in your field is concentrated in the northwest region, specifically in the top left corner. This indicates a possible localized issue, potentially related to environmental factors or a specific plant variety in that corner of the field. The infestation is classified as moderate severity, with a maximum pest count of 9 in a single cell. The cluster size is 3, indicating the presence of pests in three cells. The total number of pests in your field is 12. The field size is 5 rows and 7 columns.  

Because the infestation is moderate, a moderate pesticide treatment is recommended for the northwest corner of the field, focusing on the area with the highest pest count. Monitor the affected area closely for any spread of the infestation and consider using natural predators to supplement the pesticide treatment. Implement preventive measures like crop rotation, proper sanitation practices, and timely removal of infested plants to prevent future infestations.
