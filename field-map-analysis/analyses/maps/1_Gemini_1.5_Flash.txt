The pest infestation in your field is concentrated in the **southeast** region. This is a **low-severity** infestation with a **maximum pest count of 10** in a single cell.  The **cluster size** is **3**, and the **total number of pests** is **22**.  Your field has **7 rows** and **5 columns**, totaling **35 cells**. 

The infestation is relatively small, localized, and not widespread.  This suggests the infestation may be recent or due to a specific environmental factor affecting that area. Given the low severity, you can employ a **light pesticide treatment** targeting the southeast region of your field. You may also consider using natural predators to help control the pest population.  

To prevent future infestations, consider the following:

* **Monitor the southeastern region more closely** for any signs of pest activity. Early detection is crucial for preventing larger infestations.
* **Identify and address potential contributing factors** to pest infestations in the southeast region, such as water drainage issues, soil fertility imbalances, or specific weather patterns. 
* **Utilize preventative measures** like crop rotation, intercropping, and maintaining good field hygiene to discourage pests from establishing themselves in your field. 

By addressing the problem early and implementing preventative measures, you can minimize the impact of pests on your crops and ensure a healthy harvest.
