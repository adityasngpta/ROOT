The pest infestation in your field appears to be highly localized in the northwest corner, suggesting a potential point source for the infestation or particularly favorable conditions for the pests in that area. The severity of the infestation is high, with a maximum pest count of 10 in a single cell. While the cluster size is small, affecting only two cells, the high concentration of pests in that area warrants immediate and intensive pesticide treatment. There is a total of 14 pests in the 7x5 field.  After addressing the immediate infestation, investigate potential causes for this concentrated cluster, such as pest breeding grounds,  overwintering sites nearby, or specific environmental factors like moisture or shade favoring the northwest corner. Implement a monitoring system to enable early detection of future infestations, perhaps utilizing pheromone traps or regular scouting, especially in the previously affected area and its surroundings. This proactive approach, combined with immediate action, will help protect your crop yield and prevent similar localized outbreaks in the future.
