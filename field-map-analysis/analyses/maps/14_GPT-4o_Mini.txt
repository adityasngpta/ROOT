The provided matrix representing pest counts in your field is as follows:

```
4 4 2 0 0
7 4 10 0 0
3 3 5 0 0
0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0
```

From this matrix, we can observe that there are notable concentrations of pests in the top three rows of the field, particularly in the second row, which includes a maximum count of 10 pests located in the center cell (row 2, column 3). This indicates a significant cluster of infestation at the northeast region of your field, notably surrounding this cell and extending to adjacent cells. 

The overall severity of the infestation is classified as high, given that the maximum pest count in a single cell is 10, which exceeds the threshold of 7. The total number of pest-infested cells (cluster size) is 8, and the total number of pests across the entire field adds up to 43. The field has dimensions of 5 rows and 5 columns, which allows us to gauge the distribution and density of the pests relative to the entire area.

To address this severe infestation, immediate and intensive pesticide treatment is advisable. You should focus on applying a robust insecticide specifically targeted for the types of pests identified in your crops. Alongside chemical treatments, consider integrating biological controls, such as introducing natural predators that can help in managing the pest population sustainably.

In terms of preventive measures for future infestations, maintaining crop health through proper irrigation and nutrient management can bolster your crops' resilience. Rotating crops and ensuring that any residual debris from previous seasons is properly managed will also reduce the likelihood of pest resurgence. Furthermore, monitoring and early detection strategies such as regular scouting and using pest traps can facilitate timely interventions in the case of new infestations. With these insights and recommendations, you can effectively manage the current pest problem while taking steps to protect your crops against future threats.
