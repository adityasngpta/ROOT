The pest infestation in your field exhibits a clear cluster concentrated in the **center** of the field. This cluster is characterized by a **high severity** with a **maximum pest count of 8** located in the third row, third column. The cluster spans across **5 cells**, indicating a significant concentration of pests in this specific area. The **total number of pests** in your field is **28**.  The field size is 5 rows by 7 columns.  The concentration of pests in the center suggests a potential issue with localized environmental factors, such as a water source attracting the pests, or a specific plant variety susceptible to this particular pest. Due to the high severity, we recommend **immediate and intensive pesticide treatment** targeting the center of the field. This will effectively address the current infestation and prevent further spread. However, we also advise implementing **preventive measures** to minimize the risk of future infestations, such as rotating crops, introducing natural predators, and maintaining good sanitation practices.  Monitoring the field regularly for any signs of pest activity, especially in the center region, is crucial for early detection and timely intervention.
