The matrix provided represents a 7x5 field with pest counts for each plant. Examining the matrix reveals a clear pattern: the northwest region of the field shows a concentrated pest cluster, with significant pest activity in the first two rows and diminishing rapidly to no activity in subsequent rows.

The maximum pest count in any single cell is 8, found in the cell located at the second row and first column. The presence of pests in cells (1,1), (2,1), and (2,2) showcases the severity of the infestation in this specific area. The cluster size, or the number of cells in the matrix with pests, is 3. The total number of pests across the field is 11.

Given the high severity of this infestation (as indicated by the maximum pest count of 8), it is imperative to undertake immediate and intensive pesticide treatment to control the pest population effectively. Target the northwest region, focusing particularly on the first two rows where pest counts are significant.

Aside from applying pesticides, consider integrating natural predators that can sustainably control pest populations and reduce the reliance on chemical treatments. Regular monitoring and early detection strategies, such as deploying traps or utilizing remote sensing technology, can help manage future infestations more effectively.

The observed distribution might be due to environmental factors such as wind direction or proximity to water sources, which might favor pest proliferation in the northwest. Crop type and seasonality could also be influencing these patterns. Adjusting planting schedules, enhancing field drainage, and rotating crops could form part of long-term preventive strategies.

In summary, focus intensive pesticide application on the northwest region to manage the high pest concentration. With regular monitoring and preventive measures, you can mitigate the impact of future pest infestations and ensure the health of your crops.
