The pest distribution in your field shows a clear cluster in the **northeast** region. This cluster is characterized by high pest density, with the **maximum pest count** reaching **10** in a single cell. The **cluster size** is **3**, meaning pests are present in three cells in this region. The **total number of pests** in the field is **23**. Your field is **5 rows by 7 columns**, totaling **35 cells**. This indicates a **moderate severity** of infestation, as the maximum pest count is greater than 4. You should consider a **moderate pesticide treatment** focused on the northeast region. The concentration of pests in this specific area suggests potential environmental factors or crop characteristics may be contributing to their presence.  To prevent future infestations, consider implementing **preventive measures** such as crop rotation, monitoring for early signs of infestation, and using natural predators.
