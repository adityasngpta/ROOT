The pest infestation in your field appears to be concentrated in the northwest corner, indicating a localized cluster. This suggests a potential point source for the infestation or conditions in that area that are particularly favorable to the pests. The severity of the infestation is moderate, with a maximum pest count of 10 in one of the cells.  While the rest of the field appears to be free of pests at the moment, the cluster size is 6 cells, indicating a potential for spread if left untreated. There is a total of 27 pests in your 5 row by 7 column field. I recommend a moderate pesticide treatment for the affected area to control the infestation and prevent further spread. Consider investigating the affected area for potential causes such as weed patches, infected plant debris, or environmental factors that might be contributing to the localized infestation. Implementing a regular monitoring schedule for the entire field will allow for early detection of any future outbreaks and facilitate timely intervention.
