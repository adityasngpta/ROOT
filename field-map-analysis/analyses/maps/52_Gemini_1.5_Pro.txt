The pest infestation in your field appears to be a small, localized cluster in the center-north portion. This cluster has a maximum pest count of 5, with a total of 4 cells infested. In total, there are 13 pests present across your field. While the overall number of pests is relatively low, the concentrated nature of the infestation suggests a moderate severity level.  I recommend a moderate pesticide treatment focused on the affected area to prevent further spread. Additionally, investigate potential causes for this cluster, such as the presence of favorable microclimates or potential pest entry points from adjacent areas.  Continue monitoring the field for any changes in pest distribution or signs of spreading.  For future prevention, consider implementing cultural practices such as crop rotation and attracting natural predators to maintain a healthy balance within the field ecosystem.
