This field map reveals a localized pest infestation concentrated in the northwest corner of your field. The highest number of pests in any single cell is 8, indicating a high severity of infestation in this region. There are 4 cells with pests present, comprising a cluster size of 4, totaling 17 pests across the entire field. The field is relatively small with 5 rows and 7 columns.  The pattern suggests a potential problem with pest entry points in the northwest corner, which should be investigated to prevent future infestations.

Due to the high severity of the infestation with a maximum pest count of 8, immediate and intensive pesticide treatment is recommended to effectively control the pests in the northwest corner.  This treatment should be targeted to the area with the highest concentration of pests to minimize environmental impact. Additionally, preventative measures should be implemented to prevent future infestations, such as inspecting the field regularly for early signs of pest activity and ensuring the northwest corner has no entry points for pests.
