The matrix you provided represents a pest distribution in your field, consisting of 5 rows and 7 columns. Pest counts are indicated within the cells, showing clear areas of concentration, particularly in the lower center part of the matrix. Notably, the maximum number of pests observed in a single cell is 10, located in the cells at positions (4,5) and (4,6), indicating a significant pest presence in both clusters. The total number of pest counts throughout the matrix sums up to 61, while the cluster size, represented by the number of cells containing pests, is 11.

The spatial distribution of pests is quite concentrated toward the center and somewhat northeast of the center of the matrix, making the southeast region of your field particularly vulnerable to infestations. This pattern may suggest an abundance of favorable conditions for pest activity in that area, which could be due to factors such as higher moisture retention, the type of crops planted, or possibly less effective pest management practices in that specific part of the field.

Given that the maximum count surpasses the threshold for high severity (≥ 7), it is recommended that you take immediate and intensive pesticide treatment to manage the infestation effectively. This could include targeted application of systemic insecticides or specific pesticides that are effective against the identified pests within your crop type. Additionally, it’s crucial to monitor the area frequently over the next few weeks to gauge the effectiveness of the treatment and detect any further pest emergence.

To prevent future infestations, consider implementing crop rotation, improving plant health through appropriate fertilization and irrigation, and employing natural predators as part of an integrated pest management (IPM) strategy. Regular monitoring, using traps or pheromone lures, will also help in early detection of pests and enable timely treatments, minimizing potential crop damage. In summary, focus on managing the southeast region with immediate interventions while establishing preventive measures for long-term pest management.
