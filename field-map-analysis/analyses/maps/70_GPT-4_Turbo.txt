Analyzing the provided matrix concerning the distribution of pests in your field, it's evident that the pest infestation is concentrated towards the northeast region of your field. The pests are localized primarily in the rightmost two columns of the top two rows, specifically.

In this matrix:
- The maximum pest count in any single cell is 8, indicating the presence of a significant pest threat in that particular cell.
- The number of cells that have pests (cluster size) totals 4 out of the 35 cells in the matrix. 
- The total number of pests across the field adds up to 23.

The spatial distribution and quantity of pests suggest a high severity infestation in the northeast region of your field. Given the maximum pest count of 8, immediate and intensive pesticide treatment in this area is recommended. This intense infestation if left unchecked could significantly impact crop health due to the density of pests.

For the immediate treatment, it would be advisable to opt for a broad-spectrum insecticide that targets the type of pests indicated. Focus application on the northeast, specifically intensifying treatment on the corners where the highest concentrations were identified. This will help to curb the spread and further development of the pest population in its infancy.

Moreover, seeing that the infestation is localized, regular monitoring and targeted management should be implemented going forward. Consider introduction of natural predators and other biological control methods in other parts of the field to manage pest levels sustainably and prevent future concentrations of pest clusters.

It would also be beneficial to investigate the underlying causes of this specific clustering in the northeast area. Factors such as plant variety, soil type, moisture levels, and previous pesticide use patterns could be contributing to this distribution. Adjustments in these could potentially decrease the likelihood of future infestations.

Finally, ensure to remain vigilant and monitor the entire field regularly, employing an integrated pest management strategy to balance immediate and long-term pest control. Regular field walks, trap placements, and perhaps even drone surveillance could serve as effective monitoring tools to detect early signs of pest resurgence.
