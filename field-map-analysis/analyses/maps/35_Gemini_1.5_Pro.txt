The pest infestation in your field appears to be localized to a small cluster slightly west of the center. This cluster has a maximum pest count of 5 pests in a single cell and affects a total of 3 cells. The total number of pests in the entire field is 14, spread across your 7x5 field. While the overall pest count is relatively low, the concentrated nature of the cluster suggests a moderate severity infestation.  I recommend applying a moderate pesticide treatment to the affected area, slightly west of the center of your field, to prevent further spread.  Additionally, consider investigating the cause of this cluster â€“ are there any environmental factors like water pooling or differences in sunlight that might be contributing to pest attraction in this area?  Regular monitoring of your field, especially around the current infestation zone, will be crucial for early detection of any future outbreaks.
