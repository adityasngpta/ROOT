The pest distribution in your field shows a clear cluster concentrated in the **northeast** region of the field. This cluster is characterized by a high concentration of pests, with the **maximum pest count** being **9** in a single cell. The **cluster size** is **5** cells, and the **total number of pests** in the field is **36**. This indicates a **moderate severity** of infestation. Considering the size of your field is **5 rows and 5 columns**, the infestation is localized but needs attention. I recommend applying a **moderate pesticide treatment** specifically targeting the northeast region. This will help control the infestation while minimizing the impact on other areas of your field. For preventive measures, consider crop rotation and intercropping to disrupt pest cycles. Implement regular monitoring using traps or visual inspection to detect any early signs of infestation.  The concentration of pests in the northeast region could potentially be linked to factors like microclimate variations or a localized infestation source. Further investigation into the specific pest species and its preferred conditions could help you tailor your management strategies for greater effectiveness.
