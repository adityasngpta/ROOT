The pest infestation in your field appears to be highly localized to the northwest corner, indicating a potential early-stage infestation or a point source for the pest.  The severity of the infestation is low, as the maximum pest count is only 5.  There are only two cells in the 7x5 field (7 rows x 5 columns) with pests, resulting in a cluster size of 2. The total pest count is 8. Given the low severity and small cluster size, I recommend a light pesticide treatment or consider introducing natural predators to the affected area. This approach minimizes chemical use while effectively addressing the localized infestation.  To prevent future infestations, implement regular monitoring of your fields, focusing on early detection, particularly in areas where pests have been previously observed. This specific infestation pattern might be related to factors like wind direction, proximity to other fields with pests, or even the presence of favorable microclimates in that corner of your field.
