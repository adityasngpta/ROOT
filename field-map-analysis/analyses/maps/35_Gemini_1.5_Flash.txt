The pest infestation in your field is concentrated in the **center** region, specifically in the middle three rows and the second and third columns.  The infestation appears to be **moderate** in severity, with a **maximum pest count of 5**.  There are **3 cells** in the matrix with pests, indicating a **cluster size of 3**. The **total number of pests** in the field is **14**. Your field is **7 rows** by **5 columns** in size. Given the moderate severity, we recommend a **moderate pesticide treatment** targeting the center region.  This treatment will help control the current infestation and prevent it from spreading. You could also consider using natural predators to help control the pest population. To prevent future infestations, consider implementing crop rotation, using pest-resistant varieties, and maintaining good sanitation practices.  Regularly monitor your field for signs of pest activity, focusing on the center region, and take action early to prevent infestations from escalating. The concentrated infestation in the center might suggest an environmental factor, such as a localized moisture gradient or nutrient imbalance, that attracts the pests to this specific area.  Investigating these potential causes could lead to more effective long-term pest management strategies.
