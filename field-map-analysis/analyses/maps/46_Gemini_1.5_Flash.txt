The pest infestation in your field is concentrated in the southeast region, with a clear cluster of high pest counts in the bottom right corner of the field. The maximum pest count is 10, indicating a high severity of infestation. The cluster size is 7 cells, demonstrating a significant presence of pests in that area. The total number of pests in the field is 52. The field size is 7 rows and 5 columns. The high pest count in the southeast corner suggests a potential problem with drainage or irrigation in that area, leading to favorable conditions for the pests. The cluster could be caused by a local infestation that has spread outwards. This high severity requires immediate and intensive pesticide treatment to effectively control the pest population.  Furthermore, consider rotating crops in the future to disrupt pest cycles. Monitor the southeast corner closely, especially for signs of further spread. Additionally, assess the field's irrigation and drainage systems to identify and address any underlying issues contributing to the infestation.
