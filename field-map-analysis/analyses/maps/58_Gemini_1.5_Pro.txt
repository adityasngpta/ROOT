The pest infestation in your field appears to be concentrated in the northwest corner, suggesting a localized outbreak or a potential point source for the infestation. This cluster is relatively small, affecting only the top three rows and three columns of your field. The severity of the infestation is high, as evidenced by a maximum pest count of 10 in two separate cells.  Given the high severity, immediate and intensive pesticide treatment is recommended for the affected area (northwest corner) to prevent further spread. The total number of pests in the field is 47, with 7 cells showing signs of infestation. Your field size is 5 rows by 7 columns.  Consider investigating potential causes for this localized outbreak, such as the presence of susceptible crop varieties in that area, favorable microclimates, or potential pest migration patterns. Implementing a monitoring system with pheromone traps or regular scouting can help with early detection of future infestations, allowing for more targeted and less intensive treatments.
